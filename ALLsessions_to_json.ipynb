And how I felt not leaving the safety net of the hospital, given the fact that the night before I had quite an event where I almost passed out in the bathroom and they still sent me home the next morning. I was very apprehensive about that transition home and the fear of landing. And, and that's one of the post long haul symptoms I've had, is that living with that fear of getting, for my case, it was again, getting sick again and ending up back in hospital and experience that all over again. So that's what that kinda represents to me. Um, yeah, like it just spoke out to me and I just had to take the  photo. It was such a pleasure to do this.

I did everything in the household to all of a sudden being able to do none of that, seeing all of those health professionals, I needed to have almost a a personal attendant to keep track of the appointments because it was just so overwhelming. But nobody ever once asked me, how are you doing? Like, nobody ever ever asked how I was feeling, or how I was doing, or how I was coping, or how I was managing.

So yeah, it was, it was a good, uh, month or more before I was able to, to go back up and having three teenage boys. Um, I kind of regretted when I did actually make it up, but <laugh> <laugh>, um, yeah. But yeah, it's, uh, yeah, who would've thought stairs were the, uh, yeah, the big challenge.

I probably read five or six books, uh, about near death experiences. And through that I found the Near Death Experience Research Foundation. It's the NDEFR. And their website was really valuable to me. You actually can post, uh, your experience and they do, uh, publish it online.

I know, I know there's always lots of young children critically on that, but that will give you an opportunity and lens at life that is gonna be so much more different than that of your peers.

I did everything in the household to all of a sudden being able to do none of that, seeing all of those health professionals, I needed to have almost a a personal attendant to keep track of the appointments because it was just so overwhelming.

Now I expressed it and I had all the support in the world, but that made me reflect how for a lot of people, this is not possible. They don't have the means, they don't have the support. Um, and if anything, whenever we come out of the ICU  it's all about nourishment in all aspects, mentally, physically. I mean, for sepsis it's very important to have, you know, high protein and high calorie foods. But unfortunately my appetite was at zero. Like, it was so difficult to even put anything in. Um, so that inspired me to first of all cope with that and, and really work through my, uh, my problem of appetite, but also to eventually be becoming a patient partner and working on, you know, nutrition and, and sepsis and creating, uh, maybe some tools on the long term to help, uh, survivors, uh, in terms of their diets. So this has a few facets. Um, and definitely nutrition is a huge role whenever we come outta the ICU. Yeah.\"\n",

So this is kind of a bit of a, something I'm hoping to share with everybody and then anybody that has contact and please take this and run with the school of nursing. But I think it's, um, one of the things that was missing for me and that I've heard is done in many ICUs and particularly in UK like we, P5 and I follow UK sets, is trust and, but is, um, a journal for those that are in critical care, ICU and I know nowadays to expect, put that expectation onto nurses is unrealistic. But my message is, um, I'd like to see them have stocks of journals in every ICU and at least give to a family member that they can write and keep track because there's gaps. I have huge gaps, and I'd like to know what happened to me in the ICU.\"\n",

So, but I just thought that it's, um, it's very important that we, we somehow capture the moments and, and that, that, that's a healing journey, I think for many. And some people I've read don't wanna read that journal until much later down the continuum. But I don't know how others have felt that I certainly have questions and it was such a stressful time that when I asked my family about it, they can't always even answer because for them it was such high stress and such concerning, and that I think even having a family member to write the positive things that are happening will help them in the journey of dealing with somebody that's critically ill and, and to, you know, say, well today you, you actually opened your eyes, you know, and that that will have, they put it pen to paper.\"\n",

I've had the opportunity to speak to medical students about my experience and I shared this bit about having a journal in the ICU and two of the students approached me afterwards about that. So I'm thinking, well, wouldn't that be cool if they're a physician dealing with somebody in the ICU that might just encourage family members to get a journal and keep track of some things for them as well. So I don't know if anybody's had that opportunity or had one kept for them. Um, but I just, um, yeah, that's why I showed this photo. It's just kind of a message I'm trying to kinda encourage, and I know we can't put any more workloads on the nurses, but in these, in the past and in some places I've read the nurses actually do a journal part of that's part of their nursing care.

And I guess my words of wisdom is to continue to seek support from those that will lift us up, those that will be kind to us, those that will encourage us, those that will embrace us for who we are, regardless of our faults, regardless of our limitations or our non-limitations. And just to, um, and I wish you all to stay well healthy, happy and embracing life. And as P2 would say, get silly.\"\n",

Um, and thank you for explaining your process. Like that's incredible that you're just driving along when you see, and I, I think I spoke a little bit to that last week where something will pop up for you.\\n Amazing.\\n Um, I I have a question for you if you're open to it.\\n Um, you spoke about your fear, so, you know, fear of leaving the hospital. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?\\n Thank you, P3. I wanted to open it up and I think for efficiency sake, um, I'll go down the list that you're gonna be presenting your photo. So we'll go to P4 first, and then we'll go to P1 and P2 and P5. And then I will keep moving through that list. So, um, P4, I'm giving everybody one minute on my clock, so you don't have to take the whole minute. But if I have to cut you off, please finish your thoughts in chat.\\n Thank you, P4. We'll go to P1 next.\\n Thanks P1. And we'll go to P2.\\n Thanks, P2. AndP5,\\n Thank you so much. That's really quick, but it's also really great to see, um, some of the, the conversation that happens. So, P4, you are next. We're gonna show up your first photo here,\\n\\n I'm sorry to give anything away for your photo\\n Yeah, I'm bringing it up right now\\n Oh, I was just gonna repeat the question. What was it like to transition from hospital to home? Go ahead.\\n Thank you, P4. Um, has that changed for you, like outside of Photovoice, but have you, has that changed for you? Like by connecting with this foundation you spoke about? Or, um, I, I know that you and P3 know each other, so has that changed? Mm-hmm.\\n I'm sorry. Wrong people. Yeah. Yeah.\\n oh, that's right. Okay.\\n I mean, in general,\\n Thank you so much for sharing. I'm gonna open it up and we'll go to P1 and then P2, P5, and then P3.\\n Thank you, P2.\\n Thank you,\\n Thank you. And over to P3.\\n Thank you. I feel like a terrible timekeeper, but we're gonna move on to P1. So a Facilitator FH is gonna put up your slide for us to take a look.\\n Thank you. P1, can I ask you a question?\\n Thank you. I was just wondering how you talk about being in, in that negative space, right? Yeah. And yeah, and I'm wondering, was there something that shifted for you at some point, or do you still feel like you're, you're working your way through?\\n Thank you for sharing. And I can totally relate to that as well. I'm gonna pass it on to P2.\\n Thank you. On to P5,\\n Thank you. And P3,\\n Thank you so much. Okay. And we're gonna move on to P2. So we're gonna look at P2's first photo, and then this is all about the transition from hospital to home.\\n Thanks for sharing. Um, I just wanted to ask you more about, um, that whole idea of being invisible. And I'm wondering, like with all your experiences, has that changed over time?\\n What do think\\n <laugh>. Thank you for sharing.\\n We'll go over to P5,\\n Thank you, P3. Oh, can't hear.\\n <laugh> and P4.\\n And P1.\\n Thanks P1. Okay. And we are gonna move on to P5 transition from hospital to home.\\n Oh, we can't see, but maybe you can email us the picture later.\\n Thank you. Um, are you, can I ask you a question? So I just wanted to ask, um, you, you talked about like you had your 13 month at home and you were still recovering, so how did you make that work?\\n Thank you. I'm gonna pass it over to P3.\\n Great. And P4,\\n Excellent. And now P1.\\n That's a lovely reminder.\\n Thank you. So I'm gonna ask you, um, we're I, I have a break in the schedule. Do you want your break or do you wanna keep going?\\n\\n Okay. Was okay. Um, and\\n I just wanted to jump in though. I don't think, P2, did you have a chance to respond?\\n Oh my gosh, I'm sorry, P2. Oh, no, that's, I'm ahead. I'm terrible.\\n Thank you.\\n Okay. So thank you. And I'm so sorry P2. I'm terrible. I'm trying to fine keep it, I'm trying to, and I, I don't, yeah, I, I'm trying to keep the container so that you guys can all have the conversation and I'm trying to keep all my thoughts to myself here. So why don't we actually take two minutes If you wanna grab a glass of water, take a little stretch break, come back in two minutes. All right? Okay. Yeah, thank you. I was gonna say, that was great cuz it gave me a chance to readjust what I needed to readjust for the session. And I'm gonna show you if she's back\\n And she's sleeping.\\n Ah, right behind me. Speaker 8 (00:48:53): You're gonna love my next picture.\\n Oh, I saw very quickly. I saw and I was like, oh my God, so cute. I can't wait to hear about it.\\n Oh, P2, are you, are you trying to say something? You were on mute. You're not unmuted now. I think. Try again.\\n <laugh>. Oh, I couldn't hear myself either. <laugh> <laugh>. I'm a little too flippy with my fingers on the keyboard sometimes. Well, I hope you got a chance to grab a, a little water or have a stretch. Um, I'm drinking my cold tea. Facilitator FH, you're drinking your cold tea. We both went and got peppermint tea right before our session. Oh, okay. Um, so, so I think we're gonna, so we're gonna proceed in the same order again. Um, and do the second, um, the second question. And I think what I'm gonna do is, um, we're actually doing pretty good on time, so we'll, we'll see how things go if I need you to wind it up. Why don't I do this? Okay. This is your 10 like wrap up in about 10 more seconds. There you go. How does that look? Okay. Yeah. And then I, like I said, if you have more to say, say, and we don't have time for it, please just chat, chat, chat, and type in the chat. Excellent. So we are back over to P3 and Facilitator FH is gonna bring up your image and what were challenges and facilitators to this transition. Oh, she's so sweet.\\n Oh, it's a he.\\n <laugh>. I\\n Yeah. And the cat can't sign the consent form. So Yeah, you have to have, uh, you have to have the human around. Yeah. It's a lovely photo, um, of, of your, your facilitator, uh, to your, to, to your recovery. And, um, you know, totally relate to that. Uh, was I, how did it feel to be without in, I mean, in the hospital, like you had realized, yeah,\\n You, have some comfort.\\n Thanks Yeah. Thank you so much.\\n Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's definitely see some nods, <laugh>. Yes. And yeah, we'll go over to P4.\\n Thank you. <laugh> and P1.\\n Thank you, P1. Over to P2.\\n Thank you. And we'll move forward to P5\\n Excellent. Thank you so much. Um, so we will move on to P4. And this is your barriers and facilitators. Excellent.\\n Thank you, P4. And just to let you know that we will be addressing mental health, um, in a later session, I think not next week, but the week after. So we'll be talking more extensively. Um, may I ask you a follow up? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> question. Um, I'm just wondering, so you talk about this mask that you had to put on and you had to be okay for your, you know, your immediate family and your, and sort of whole things together. Did you have moments where it was okay to, to just feel what you were feeling?\\n And at this point, does your family even realize that, or is the, that mask still in place?\\n Thanks for sharing. I'm gonna turn it over to, P1, to start us off.\\n Thanks P1. And we'll move on to P2.\\n Thank you. And over to P3.\\n Thank you. Okay, so now we're gonna move on to P1's photo. So challenges and facilitators.\\n Thank you P1. It sounds like, um, yeah, taking things for granted like sunlight and then you sort of rediscovering that for your, for yourself. I just wanted to dial back a little bit. Um, so you talked a a lot about like, expectations of your family and the people around you and feeling like a failure. Can I, can I ask, like, do you still feel that same way today? Has that shifted a lot for you? Or is this something you're working on?\\n Thank you, P1. I'm gonna throw it over to P2.\\n Thanks P2. Well go to P5.\\n Thank you. And over to P3.\\n Thank you. Hey, and we are gonna move on to P2.\\n It's just taking a minute, aren't we doing it says your screen. Yeah, it says your screen share. It's just taking a minute. There we go. Okay.\\n <laugh>. Thanks P2. So I'm wondering what it feels like that when, so you're saying you come back from the hospital and these things, like the stairs is insurmountable. What is it like when you're actually, you make it up the stairs or you don't have to sit on the little stool? Um, because I'm sure it probably feels like you're gonna have to be on the stool forever, right?\\n All good, P2, thank you P5.\\n Thank you. Over to P3.\\n Thank you. Okay, so we're gonna move on to P5\\n Thank you so much for that. Um, so knowing your background that you are indeed a nutritionist, um, I'm just wondering, did you, did people cook for you or did you order, order in healthy food? Like how did you, how did you manage that whole, whole nourishment?\\n Thank you for that. And we will go to P3 first\\n <laugh>. Excellent. We'll go to P1 and then P2. Mm-hmm.\\n Definitely. Thank you P2.\\n Thank you. It's amazing how food connects us or can disconnect us from our experiences. Just because we have a couple minutes, I'm gonna share with you that, um, I, when I was in my hospital stay, which we've all talked about, um, I couldn't eat. I was so nauseous, couldn't keep anything down and didn't want to eat. So again, the dietician came to see me and, and told me, you know, we're gonna get creative and send you some good food. And that night she sent me the stinkiest fish. I opened up like the, the dome, the, and I was just like, yeah, like there's no way. And I still like, I'll still cook fish every once in a while, but I was on a business trip with my boss and a couple people and we went to this restaurant and it was all fish and I had to proceed with caution because I still like, think of that smelly, nasty fish <laugh> from Y and yeah, like, I, I so agree.\\n Like the little bits on your plate kind of thing. Um, I just wanted to say that really lovely discussion and I just love watching how you're all supporting each other and lifting each other up. Cuz I know we are, we are talking about hard things and as we go through the weeks, um, the topics get a little, a little bit more heavier, but also a little bit more hopeful too. I'm hoping that there will be, um, some hope as we proceed through the weeks. So, um, I was gonna give us extra space to have some discussion, but you were already having such lovely discussion. So I think what we'll do right now is we will show you your next assignment.\\n So this next assignment is all about organization and technology. So what did you do to organize and adapt your life in your home at first and what you're doing now or what's ongoing for you and what did you or your family and your family need at home at first and ongoing. So that's what we're gonna focus on for next week, sort of the organization of your home, the setup of your home, however you wanna interpret those questions. Any questions. And I believe Facilitator FH, you're gonna send out the questions and reflection sheets and everything after, after, um, our meeting today.\\n Yeah. And I, I can send out the same sheets that you have, but I'll just embed the questions in them just so it's for ease of use. Um, and like you've all done this pastime, feel free to interpret, combine, um, you know, take photos and speak to the aspects that resonate with you. Mm-hmm. This is really an exploration of what, what's important for, for you. And, um, and we're learning from you. Uh, we may have these guiding questions, but um mm-hmm. <affirmative>, there's stuff that's missing from them too, right? So feel free\\n To Absolutely.\\n To um, be as creative as you'd like with the questions.\\n We all got quiet all of a sudden.\\n Ah-huh <laugh>. Excellent. So don't forget, I've got a couple of reminders. Don't forget to upload or email your photos at least an hour before the next session. You can email either of us if you're stuck, you need help. Um, if anything was distressing, please reach out. Um, yeah, as we check out, maybe what we can do is describe today's session for you in one word. So who would like to start?\\n I love that.\\n Because you love it. P2, you're going next.\\n Enlightenment. Thank you.\\n Thankful.\\n And I'm gonna jump into and just say, um, I gonna do two words admiration for the bravery that you have to talk from the heart, um, about such, you know, really tough stuff and gratitude that you are showing up here for yourselves and for each other and, um, for being willing to share. Thank you.\\n I don't know what I could say after all. Hearing all of this, I think I'm really excited to see how this group is forming and moving through these exercises and, um, seeing the commonalities and the differences that are coming out. But I just wanted to say thank you for sharing of yourselves. This is not easy to do and here we are in a Zoom environment. Um, but you're trusting in us. You're trusting in each other. Um, and with that, I will wish you a wonderful week. \"}\n",
            "{'participant': 'P3', 'speech': \" Okay. So I went out with an idea in mind of a photo that I wanted to take. It was of a road, actually, just the road. Cause that's why I felt like it was, the journey behind me was a road and the journey, another long road. And then as I was coming, this was taken at the park. And as I was coming outta the park off to my right, I saw this and I just like almost slammed on the brakes. Unfortunately, nobody was behind me. I had to get off the side of the road. It just spoke to me. So I just got very emotional because the whole time I've been thinking about what did I want this photo to be, et cetera, et cetera. And it just spoke to me about the fact that it was like I was having to cross from one point to another.\\n I was leaving the safety of the hospital and then to kind of an unknown. The picture, represents the unknown on the other side, and it's almost a bit of a hill. And, and at the same time, that log is covered in moss. So to transfer that log could be dangerous, could be scary. And how I felt not leaving the safety net of the hospital, given the fact that the night before I had quite an event where I almost passed out in the bathroom and they still sent me home the next morning. I was very apprehensive about that transition home and the fear of landing. And, and that's one of the post long haul symptoms I've had, is that living with that fear of getting, for my case, it was again, getting sick again and ending up back in hospital and experience that all over again. So that's what that kinda represents to me. Um, yeah, like it just spoke out to me and I just had to take the  photo. It was such a pleasure to do this. Like, it was like, wow, I gave lots of time to think. Do you want me to go through the questions?\\n\\n Well, I did have pictures of the road where I actually stood, I making sure there no traffic. And I got middle of the road and great. And I was happy with that. I, that's my photo. I can speak to that then\\n Driving back. This just, I don't know, there's just something about, it spoke out to me.\\n Yes.\\n Um, yeah, I mean, my hospital stay was 58 days long, so it was a long, long recovery for me. And I was going home with still existing problems. I was not a hundred percent recovered. I was facing the likelihood of another major surgery, which I did have, but, put off for at least another year. Cause I was just too terrified to go back and have more surgery. Um, but, and also just that fear of, um, I knew that there was some risk factors associated with being back at home and fear of would I ever get back to myself again? Because I was like, I mean, I was using a walker. I could barely, I needed help to shower. I needed help to, like, I was far from the person I was before I got ill. Far from, there was a lot of anger in the hospital when about that too. Um, but, so it was, it was definitely a fearful time.\\n Hi, P4. Um, I, um, I didn't have an ND yeah, I was near death, but, and had to be a lot of things done. But, um, if anything, you know what? I take some comfort in hearing what you just have to say because you had an ND which meant you, you got a glimpse into what is beyond what we experience here. And the fact that you said you didn't wanna come back must mean that it's an amazing, beautiful place. So thank you for sharing that. I look for, I'd like to hear your story. I feel sad that you can't share that with your family, um, and feel that you could be heard and understood. Um, so, um, my ears are open. My heart is open with an intention of understanding, if you ever wanna share it with somebody. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.\\n It's, you know, I was very fortunate. I had people that couldn't fully understand all I went through, but were there with me every day and watching, and, you know, many, many days in the hospital in a long recovery. So, um, but, um, your picture is very, um, touching and I, I hope you find some comfort and is able, you're able to let that guilt you feeling go as well. Thank you. Life is good. Enjoy <laugh>, you know, find the gratitude and the fact that you are here and, and, uh, you'll be there. You get to, you will get there again. Yeah, we don't know where and when, but yeah.\\n I think P5 almost kind of summed what I was going to say. You are a very smart, articulate, insightful young woman, P1. And your picture and what you saw in that photo and how you were able to relate it is astounding. You're, you know, somebody of your age, and I think very P5 said, you're an old soul now. You've experienced something that most people don't go through. I know, I know there's always lots of young children critically on that, but that will give you an opportunity and lens at life that is gonna be so much more different than that of your peers. And the fact that, you know, yeah, I can't imagine I'm, you're going, I, I can't imagine coming out and that age particularly and seeing everyone going on. And that's an age where people won't stop to wanna really engage and understand where you're coming from. Cause life is twofold for them. But, um, I think that, um, over time, those friendships, if they sustain and carry on for many, many years, that you'll be able to share it on a much different level with them moving forward. And, um, yeah, thank you for sharing that. Cause you know, we relate to our experiences, and I was an older lady when it happened. Not that old clarify that\\n But I just thank you for sharing.\\n Sorry, I go off and on on my muting. So, um, lovely photo. And it could get, um, yeah, like we all had that period that who's gonna understand this and, and wanting to, and I remember days wanting to just kinda curl up in my room, but you used the word vulnerable, and I know that resonated with me because I was used to being the caregiver, um, as the retired nurse. So, um, and then having to rely on others to care for me, and not being able to do the simplest of tasks in my home. I couldn't, like I said, I had to have a family member that basically happy, had to work, he had to get back to work. I mean, he did while I was hospitalized, um, and a sister that put her life on hold because I needed full-time care at the home when I was discharged.\\n And that's, that was hard. That's a very vulnerable place to be in and to have to rely on others. And a very, at times, as much as you were joyful, full of, thank God I'm home and I'm on the mend , and I'm, I can, I will get better. I just had to keep telling yourself that It was times where, yeah, it was a dark kinda lonely place that you just felt like you just wanted to stay in the shadows, and you just wanted that, I don't know what I would call it. Just time to grieve. That's what it was.\\n Yeah,\\n And I bet you are an angel,\\n I love the picture, P5. That's gorgeous. And I keep my eye up for those kinda sunsets. I don't know any of you guys here. Most of us here I think are on the west Coast. Oh my God. We were treated to a stunning sunset last night, like just raising red. It was nothing like I've ever seen before, so probably should have run out and taken a picture of that. But anyhow, um, yeah, and I think it's like, um, you know, um, it was just spoke to and, and to think that, you know, like there, you know, the barriers that were in front of you, yet there was something beautiful behind those barriers that, you know, to look forward to. And I knew for you, you're beautiful children and your young family, and were, were such, um, motivators. And, um, yeah. So thank you. Lovely picture.\\n Yeah.\\n It's a he by the way.\\n Yeah, that is, uh, Abe, his actual name, his registered name was Honest Abe. But we just call him Abe or Abert, and you about facilitators. He was in my recovery and one of the first things I couldn't to get home too, I mean, I saw my husband in the hospital. I had my sister, my son was visiting, friends, came to visit. But this love of my life here, my poor baby. At one point we talked about them bringing him into the hospital, but he's, um, he is pretty stressed out when he rides in the car. He doesn't like riding the carrier. So I didn't wanna put him through that. But, um, so, and it was, um, interesting. I couldn't wait to see him as we walked through the doors. I came in through the garage cause I, I had to hold onto walls and things to get into the house.\\n He was having what he has like asthma and asthma attacks. So it wasn't quite the welcoming I was expecting. And then he ignored me for about 10 minutes and I was heartbroken, what do you mean? And then from there on in, he was my shadow and he still is. So, um, he played a big role and just like that was something normal. That was something important for me to get home to, um, that I couldn't have while I was in recovery while I was [inaudible] in the hospital. So he was one of my biggest facilitators. I guess the big thing missing is the other people in my life, but, um, printer's not working. And the biggest one, I mean, I have my husband here, but my sister will be huge role, but she in prints ever dial in to get the consent forms and everything's fine. Would've been just too much of a hassle. So, but so that's missing from this photo. But, um, yeah, he is, uh, pets give that unconditional love. And so for those times, feeling like nobody understood and nobody could, you know, not that I had that experience too much, but it was just there in my face constantly. So he's my love, one of them. Sorry Rob. My husband's on the couch, so I gotta make sure he hears that.\\n Understand. He says <laugh>.\\n I worried about him, because he is mine. You know, like it cats little attached to, and, and, and there were days where my husband, once he got back to work, um, he'd be out of the house at five in the morning and then he worked, I was ended up transferring to, um, [hospital]. But, um, so my husband would be out of the house from five in the morning and after his day of work come to the hospital every day, he never missed a day to come see me, ever. Oh. Ever, ever. And so he would be getting home some nights at, I'd be kicking him out at 6 30, 7 at the hospital saying, you gotta go home. So that's cat spent hours and hours alone. So I worried about him. So yeah. So <laugh>, it was a good thing to get home to him knowing that he would have somebody around\\n Yeah, and my sister was here. She was back and forth and she'd come faithfully every day she'd get up. And for somebody that lives in small Prince  Rhode Island, having to drive from [city] to harassments every day was a nerve-wracking experience. But she did it. And, uh, so she was out of the house a lot, but she did her best to comfort him while I wasn't. Yeah.\\n Hospitals do allow pet visits now. So I think that's something we should be encouraging.\\n He stays there. He, he likes to get up right up here\\n We'll have to put them together. P5\\n Thanks\\n I hope I can talk without crying. <laugh>\\n\\n But like P5, I hope at some point in time that you'll feel maybe some vulnerability to share with your family, some of what you've been feeling as they progress. I don't know how long ago you were sick and where everybody is, if it's still too soon. But I think that that's an important thing for you to be able to move forward and to, um, be okay with not being okay because, um, yeah. And that's for Smokey. Yeah, actually, that song hits lots for me. I spent my entire life dealing with obesity and tracks of my tears are a song that speaks a lot to living life and putting on faces that you're okay and you're fine. So, um, but it's like P5 says, hopefully you can let that mass go sometimes and feel safe or find a group or people that you can, and hopefully we're one of them right now, but others in your real life and reach out to somebody. Do you have a siblings that you could, like you talked about a sister that has had a shared experience.\\n Yeah. Cause she's had an severe illness that maybe, you know, she's one that you could share, like you guys could find some common ground with and, you know, but yeah. Thank you for sharing that. Yep.\\n Thank you for sharing. That picture was beautiful. Yeah, it, it really speaks to so much.\\n Exactly. Very mature. And maybe there, that is something that came out of your experience, right? A maturity that probably isn't seen amongst your peers, I'm sure of it. Um, I shouldn't say that, but you, you bring a different perspective. And I'm just curious some of the wording that you use, damage goods and, and not being that if, if it's often our own perceptions that get in our way versus with was were your parents genuinely feeling that way or were they just, you know, um, that we put a lot on ourselves and they are our barriers and, and I know from me in recovery sometimes that was a barrier because of expectations or thoughts that I thought of where I should be and wasn't, or could be and wasn't. Um, so, but um, the, your ability to take a picture like that when I first thought I thought, what is she going to be speaking to in this picture?\\n Like, or I guess it was like my first one. Some of you thought, what has that got to do with? And, and then you so eloquently defined it. And, um, you know, and, and that even in our dysfunctional states, we are still as valuable and always will be. And that light was still there as you noted. And that can very quickly be fixed. You know, it'll take somebody to come along and put that back up. So that, that is a working functional piece. And, and that's what happens to us in our recovery pieces. People help to put it back together. We put it back together. And maybe it's not gonna look perfect to need a repair though, but it's still is a very valuable asset and safety of people walking down that street. So thank you for sharing it.\\n I love the photo. That is a beautiful shot. And if anything, it's an inviting photo. I wanna go up those stairs. I wanna, I, they don't scare me. Cause if you look to the other side, I wanna go up those stairs and go through that door. Cause what's beyond that door. And I think that, um, you kinda captured, and I'm hoping P1 takes from this, that even though things are broken, they're just fine and there's beauty in both and that they're still functional, they're still doable, they're still, and look that they welcome you into something further. So I think it was a beautiful photo and a good way to, like, stairs are a barrier. I was lucky I came home for one level home cause I could never have managed stairs. I don't know what I would've done. I don't know what we would've done if I'd had to manage stairs to come home. We've had to arrange ambulance transport and have them carrying up the stairs because there's no way I could have done it. I was so physically, physically impossible to do that. I know that. So thank you for sharing.\\n What can I say that a picture of food? How surprising was that?\\n Um, absolutely. And you know, it, it is multicomplex because you speak to, you also spoke to the fact that for many, you have to rely on others to do that for you.\\n Okay. Hope he's okay. Um, mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. So, and, um, well aware, uh, that, uh, that was a big part of my recovery as well so long and having to reintroduce food back into my diet and, and that loss of appetite. It's probably one of the only few times in my life I didn't have an appetite. Um, um, no, I think it's, um, it's just, uh, one of the facets, like you spoke to the fact that, and how it's led you to taking something negatively that happened to you and turning it into something so positive. So positive. Thank you.\\n Thankful.\"}\n",
            "{'participant': 'P4', 'speech': \" Yeah. So first off, P3, I amazing photo and I so can relate to what you're talking about and had many of the same feelings and concerns that you did. And, you know, when you were describing it and you were describing your photo and how it spoke to you, it, it did really, you know, evoke a lot of emotion, uh, in me because, um, yeah, it, it's very, very, very close to the heart. So, um, thank you for sharing and that is a, a really, really good photo. Thank you.\\n Uh, no, let's, let's do the other one first, if that's okay. I think. Yeah.\\n No, no, that's fine.\\n So I can, I think, oh, yeah.\\n So, I think I kind of approached it a little differently. I kind of lumped the question altogether in one. So I think really both of my photos kind of speak probably to both aspects, but this more to the first question. And I also didn't do the, um, reflection questions individually. I kind of read them and thought about them and then kind of lumped it in. And I, I did write something. I just, I'm less nervous than I do better <laugh> if I have something written out. So I'll just go through and, and kind of wrote, uh, what I wrote about this. So this was called on the outside looking in. And what I wanted to capture in this image is that that's really how I felt when I returned home from the hospital. Um, my life had been so profoundly changed. I didn't really know, you know, who I was, how I fit in, how I was gonna move forward and everything around me.\\n You know, my family, like, they all just kept going. And I really did feel like, you know, I was on the outside looking in on all the activity and everything that was going on. Um, everyone was happy and they were very alive and doing everything they normally do. Um, my kids were going to all their activities and my husband's going to work, and, you know, my parents were luckily here. Um, but I didn't feel that way and I didn't feel that they understood, you know, what I had been through and how it had affected me. And I think one of the things that affected me most deeply during my experience was I actually did have a near death experience. And, you know, I don't know if anybody else had that and if they might be willing to share after I, I would be curious to know.\\n But, uh, that was very, very, uh, it was a very life altering and profound experience, but I had absolutely nobody that I could talk to about that. I didn't feel that I could share it with anybody. I was worried people wouldn't understand. They wouldn't believe me. I was worried. They might think I was, you know, a little bit crazy. Um, I felt really alone, really isolated. So I did a lot of research, uh, you know, on the internet. I got lots of books from the library. I probably read five or six books, uh, about near death experiences. And through that I found the Near Death Experience Research Foundation. It's the NDEFR. And their website was really valuable to me. You actually can post, uh, your experience and they do, uh, publish it online. And so it just allowed validation for me of my experience and made me feel like I wasn't alone in that.\\n And, um, that was really the therapeutic to be able to share. And I also felt, I guess, a little bit guilty because part of, there was a part of me that, you know, when I was going through that didn't want to come back and to have felt that way. And then to be back, you know, I felt guilty, you know, every, all anyone said to me, I, I couldn't complain about anything. I couldn't complain about how I was feeling because all I would get is, well, you're alive. You, you're not dead. You're alive. You should be happy that you're alive. And I, I just, um, I felt guilty, I guess, for not feeling happy that I'd survived, because now I was living with all the pain and the life altering ramifications of what had happened. And I really felt like I was standing on the outside looking in, and that nobody really could understand or help me.\\n <affirmative>? Oh, no, we don't know. No. Oh,\\n\\n Yeah.\\n Not, not a lot. I mean, I have, I have shared it with, uh, a few friends, but again, I mean, unless you've really experienced that and you've been through that, I mean, I, I don't think people really do understand or can understand. Um, you know, I haven't shared it with, you know, my parents or, or anybody. I briefly kind of alluded to it with my husband, but I don't know. He's, he's very factual and, and very matter of fact. And, uh, he's, he's a surgeon physician himself. And so, you know, he just, he sees, you know, he just says, well, I just see the worst of the worst and nothing phases me. And, you know, he just doesn't really have a lot of, I guess, empathy or sympathy or understanding along those lines. But yeah,\\n Thank you.\\n Thanks, P3. Thank you for sharing, P1. That was, that was very, very touching. And I, I really love the phrase that you use, that you're not alone, but you're lonely. And that really resonated with me. Um, so true. But, uh, I really, yeah, it was, it was beautiful. So thank you for sharing.\\n Yeah, a great photo. I just, the, just the way the angel is in the corner with the shadows, um, really, really great. And I, I pretty much could reiterate exactly what P3 just said. Um, you know, I, I too am in the healing profession. I'm a giver. It was really, really hard to be on the other end of that, and having to accept help and having to learn how to accept help, and also wanting to just at times become invisible and just, you know, stay in bed and not get up, but just having to sort of charge forward and move on and, and, uh, so absolutely. Great. That was great photo. Thank you.\\n Beautiful picture. And P5, I just wanna say, um, I just, I love your positivity and I love your, you have a real gift at just being able to listen to what people are saying and then really having that nice, positive, encouraging, uplifting spin. So I, I really appreciate that about you. And, and it's, it's really lovely. Thank you.\\n I'm good.\\n Gorgeous cat. Uh, I do not have a pet. Um, I kind of wish that I did. I have three teenage boys instead, and I probably would've gotten more, um, comfort and sympathy and, uh, attention from a, from a cat or a dog, uh, than my three teenage boys. But that's what it is.\\n And again, like I said, I I kind of just meshed both the questions together, <laugh>, so mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, so I'll, I'll, I'll try. But, um, the title of this one is The Tracks of My Tears. And really it was inspired by the song by Smokey Robinson. And for those of you that aren't familiar, I won't, I won't sing it, but I'll just, uh, say a line, um, take a good look at my face. You'll see my smile looks out of place. And if you look closer, it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears. And I think one of the hardest things in coming home was I was feeling so vulnerable and just crushed and feeling my emotions were all over the place. But, you know, the second that I stepped out of the car to make my way into the house, I felt like I had to put a mask on.\\n Um, I had to put on my brave face, and I didn't feel that I was allowed to show, um, what I was really experiencing. Um, a lot of that was just my, my need to feel like I had to protect everybody around me. That I had to put their emotions and their feelings and their needs above mine, even though I was in such a low place. And, um, my parents were flying out from Nova Scotia on the day that I, you know, went into, uh, severe medical distress and ended up, you know, in the ICU. Um, but they had no idea because they were coming. I was supposed to have knee surgery three days later, so they were coming for my knee surgery. And they didn't know until they landed at the airport that everything had gone sideways. And that, um, you know, things had gotten really bad and my mom didn't cope very well.\\n Um, my sister had ended up in the ICU several years ago when she had my niece with sepsis, which I know many of you can, uh, relate to, and, you know, almost died. And my mom never really recovered from that. I think she had a lot of PTS D. So when she found out that, you know, what had happened to me, uh, she really wasn't co coping well. And so I was more worried about how everybody else was doing. Um, so, you know, my kids were really traumatized by the event. They were all, they were here when it happened. Uh, my husband and my oldest son had to do CPR on me at home. Um, so I mean, they, you know, my oldest son was having his own PTSD and traumatized. Um, when I came home, you know, I was experiencing huge anxiety.\\n I was having panic attacks, I was having heart palpitations. I couldn't sleep. But I, I just had to go through that on my own, you know, I couldn't say anything. And despite how much pain I was in or how low, you know, I was feeling, or how much I just wanted to sit and cry, I, I just had to slap the smile on my face and pretend like everything was fine. Um, I had to have a, one of the complications while I was in the ICU  is I had, I developed compartment syndrome in my left arm from a, a, a ruptured, uh, brachial artery from an art line. So I had to have an emergency fasciotomy. So my left arm was completely cut open, unusable. Um, I was in a lot of pain. My mom was really, really upset about my arm. And so I just had to say, you know, oh, it's fine.\\n Oh, look how good it is today. You know, like, look, I can, I can lift it <laugh>. Um, but, you know, I couldn't feed myself. I couldn't look after myself. I couldn't do anything. But again, I just felt that need to put on the mask of the person who was happy and unaffected and feeling great when the reality is that I was feeling the opposite. And I think the biggest challenge of transitioning to home really was, um, for me, like that mental health aspect. Um, you know, I was seeing orthopedic surgeons for my knee. I was seeing plastic surgery for my fasciotomy, and I needed more surgery for that. I was going, having to go to the hand clinic for hand rehab. I was seeing hematology for my anticoagulation in my genetic workup. I was seeing vascular surgery. I had post thrombo-, I have post thrombolytic syndrome.\\n I had to have more MRIs. I was seeing cardiology for echoes and monitoring of my pulmonary pressures. I was seeing wound care for looking after my open wound. I was having to have weekly visits with my family physician. I was seeing physiotherapy. Um, and I went very quickly from being a healthy person. I was incredibly active. I played tennis. I went hiking. I had a meaningful job. I looked after my family. I looked after my house. I did everything in the household to all of a sudden being able to do none of that, seeing all of those health professionals, I needed to have almost a a personal attendant to keep track of the appointments because it was just so overwhelming. But nobody ever once asked me, how are you doing? Like, nobody ever ever asked how I was feeling, or how I was doing, or how I was coping, or how I was managing. So on my own, I did seek out some mental health support and I ended up finding, um, a psychologist that I could go and see on my own. But that should have been part of everything. And that should have been from the get-go, um, when you're sent home from the hospital with all of this going on. Um, I think that that really needs to be addressed.\\n If I was by myself, not, not with anybody.\\n Yeah, no. Like, I still can't, I, you know, I, my, my mom is having her own, you know, they, they were only here for a couple weeks and then they had to go back to Nova Scotia, and then, um, my niece came out from Calgary to look after me. Um, but I mean, no. I mean, I, I still have to, um, just pretend, you know, that my, my, um, recovery's going really, really well and that every, you know, like, I, I had an ultrasound last Friday and, um, you know, I still have lots of clot, you know, still in my legs. And now I have to go and have another, um, uh, VQ scan in my lungs again. And, um, I had an appointment with the hematologist today, but, you know, I won't, I won't tell my mom that or talk to my mom about that or anything. Cause it's just, I just have to say, oh, I'm doing great. Everything's fine. Doing great, doing my physio. It's great.\\n Thank you.\\n Yeah, my sister's in Calgary. Um,\\n Oh, thank you.\\n Yeah, thank you. I can't believe that you found that perfect picture <laugh> to express all of that. It really was. Um, I don't think I've seen a lot of busted, um, walk, sign, uh, things on. So that was, was really, really, um, coincidental that you just found that absolutely perfect photo. And, um, yeah, I can relate, um, to what you say just about having those feelings, um, at times that, you know, you are a bit damaged. Um, I said, you know, after everything had happened that, you know, I couldn't walk, I couldn't use my arm, I couldn't do anything. I said, gosh, I'm all washed up at 48 <laugh>. Um, but, you know, time, time has a way of, uh, of healing things and of moving forward and, uh, I do hope that you're, you're feeling a bit better, um, about yourself and about that.\\n Yeah, the, the photo of your stairs was really beautiful. And I think, uh, all of us view stairs differently now. <laugh>, you never think that those are gonna be the thing that, that trips you up. Um, you know, I was, I was lucky because I was planning for a knee surgery, um, for which I knew I was gonna be non-weightbearing for six to eight weeks post. So I had bought myself a cot on Amazon and I had my cot set up. I I live in a three-story house, um, cot set up on the main level and I had all that in place and good thing I did. Um, cause I, I wasn't allowed to do the stairs, uh, when I came home just because of my pulmonary function and my, my heart and whatnot. I was, I was told not to do any stairs. So yeah, it was, it was a good, uh, month or more before I was able to, to go back up and having three teenage boys. Um, I kind of regretted when I did actually make it up, but <laugh> <laugh>, um, yeah. But yeah, it's, uh, yeah, who would've thought stairs were the, uh, yeah, the big challenge. But yeah, thanks for, thanks for sharing\\n Uh, but I thought I, I work in pediatric nephrology. Um, but I thought it was really funny when I was in the ICU, because the dietician came to see me and she goes, oh, I'm the dietician. The first thing I said was like, I'm a dietician <laugh>. And she said, I, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna put you on a high protein diet, you know, for your wound healing and blah, blah, blah. I'm like, oh, okay. And then I, I really wish, I mean, I, I didn't have my phone, uh, in the ICU with me, but I, I wish I had have taken a picture of, um, what arrived. But, um, I couldn't feed myself because I, I had my fasciotomy on this arm and I had tons of lines going into this arm. I couldn't bend it, so I couldn't feed myself. But the ICU, that was fine.\\n Cause I had my, my private nurse that fed me, but she took the, the lid off the, the dinner that night. And it was literally like one teeny tiny chicken, like drum it, I think two tablespoons of white rice and like one tablespoon of like canned or frozen green beans. And I was looking at it like, okay, I don't know what calorie level you set me up for <laugh>, or, but this is definitely not, uh, high protein. But anyway, um, but one thing I, I did wanna mention, um, as I I said earlier, you know, I was, I was really bad at, um, asking for help or accepting help or I just found that part really difficult. And so what one of my, um, dietician colleagues did is, uh, she actually started a meal train. So it's actually an online program or, or, or platform that you, um, you create sort of a little, you know, um, blurb about what the person is experiencing and going through, and then you send it out.\\n Um, so she sent it out to all the dieticians at the hospital as well as all my nephrology, um, coworkers and, um, had their slots days that you sign up to deliver a meal and, um, bring a meal by. And so that was really helpful. It's not something that I would've, I would've asked for. Um, it was something I desperately needed because not only it wasn't me, it was my family. Um, you know, cuz I'm the one who takes care of my family and I'm the one who cooks for everybody and my family. And so when I was no longer able to do that, you know, there was no one to do that. Um, so that, that was a really, really, um, really kind, uh, thing that she did. And, uh, I had no choice but to accept it because it was arriving on my doorstep. So <laugh>,\\n I don't know if this is the exact right word, but I guess, um, just a solidarity.\"}\n",
            "{'participant': 'P1', 'speech': \" I also want you to say, um, thank you for sharing. And at first when I saw your photo, I wasn't really sure what you were gonna talk about cause it was so, um, abstract almost. Um, but yeah, as you went on, I, I definitely see the connection and, um, especially the part about, uh, you said how when you went back home, um, you were largely dependent on other people for their physical support and, you know, also just, um, to maintain your health and wellbeing and yeah, absolutely. It's like going back home and needing to rely on people. Definitely felt, um, it was, it was definitely new, especially when you're so used to having like nurses and, um, other staff assist you. But, um, yeah, being in the hands of family and friends definitely feels different. Um, but yeah, thank you for sharing your deal.\\n Good eye there, good thought P5\\n Yeah. Um, I wanna start with saying that everything you just said resonated so deeply with me, and it's, it's really touching and I have a lot of respect for you to have gone through that experience. Um, it's actually really surprising because I think my exact photo, uh, my photo, like, talks about the exact same thing, <laugh>. Um, but, uh, one thing I, I did wanna note is the near death experience thing. Um, I also explored the site, and I think, um, yeah, a after going through something like that, it really, it, it feels like your world view com completely changes. Um, at least for me, it did. Um, and I, I think like, well, I mean, I kind of went to cardiac arrest for, for a bit, and it, um, it, it just made me a lot more fearful, I think. Um, but there was also like a really strong need to be grateful because, you know, like you said, like at least you're not dead, right? Um, but yeah, it's a, it's definitely a really isolating experience. And, um, I'm honestly sorry, you have to go through that too. But, um, I, I do hope you can find the support you need now, and hopefully it's not as isolating. Um, but yeah, there, um, I hope, you know, it's not just you, but\\n Oh, yeah. Um, so my photo is actually from, uh, taken from inside the sky train. Um, and, you know, when you look outside doors, you can kind of see, um, a view of the landscape. Um, but yeah, so when I think of home, I think of, um, the people that make home, home is more like a group or a people thing. Um, and so, yeah, I think of like, looking at this view, um, I thought of my transition and going back into these relationships and how they changed when I transitioned back home. Um, and so like standing on the sky train, you know, you're looking down at everyone. Um, and then I, I really felt like I was omniscient and I was, I was just looking at everyone's life's past in front of me. Um, so I, I definitely felt very much behind then. This was kind of at a time, and I was at an age where everyone was rapidly progressing in their lives.\\n Um, you know, having just graduated high school, I, I wanted to do so much, but I felt held back, um, because of all these, like, medical issues, right? Um, so yeah, I felt really like inhibited by life's hand, I guess. And there was a really strong sense of unfairness that I couldn't help but dwell in. Um, and I tried really hard to not feel like I was at a disadvantage. Um, but there were definitely times where the negativity got to me when, you know, when I was transitioning home. Um, and yeah, so it was really hard to ever speak about why I was so distant and, um, behind in my studies or, you know, in pursuing my goals, um, as a teenager. Um, but yeah, it was just kind of tough because there was no one really in my immediate environment that I could truly empathize with or that could really support me.\\n Um, and that was hard because at the same time, I really depended on their physical support, um, you know, being so weak and fragile. Um, and it, it was hard because everyone was so cautious when talking to me, like they wanted to pry and learn more, but they were also scared of offending me. And so it was like, I was so far out of reach and so disconnected, like standing on a sky train, right? You're so, you're so high above, you're so far from everyone. And I, I've thought about how transitioning back was really more about, um, transitioning back into my relationships. And, um, and, and that just left me feeling very much disconnected. Um, like being in a sky train, both strangers, um, you know, you're, you're, you're not alone, but still lonely. Um, and that's, that's something how I felt.\\n Of course. Yeah.\\n I, I can't say, you know, I'm, I'm like much less negative now, but, um, I think gradually I was able to become less cynical and um, it, it was definitely a path to stop, you know, dwelling in myself, pity. But, um, I, I will say when things, when I get, I get triggered easily by, uh, uh, um, my sensory environment and, um, in times like that, I, I tend to fall back in to spells of negativity.\\n Oh, thank you for your response.\\n Yeah, honestly, I feel like everyone else has already taken words outta my mouth. <laugh>, I really, I really do wanna say that, um, I, I, I am honestly so amazed that you, um, survived going back in and out. Um, I would, I would imagine each time to be, you know, a new different type of trauma. And I gotta give you props for making, you know, and still being honestly, seemingly very cheerful and optimistic about it all. Um, amid being, you know, having felt isolated and, um, being, being forced to be independent while also reliant on others for help. Um, it's, it's a conflicting feeling for sure. Um, but you are definitely strong and it shows\\n Yeah. Your, um, your picture was, and the way you explained it was incredibly artistic, actually. It felt so poetic. Um, but like P4 said, I, I really, really respect the optimism and how you can find such beautiful moments, um, even when you're going through it. I, I think that is definitely a gift. Um, and then to notice, you know, the year after I'd make the connection <laugh> that it's like almost a sign, right? Um, that, that is <laugh>, honestly really lovely. And, um, it made me really happy hearing that actually,\\n Yeah.\\n Yeah, I wanted to say that was kind of like heartwarming, honestly. <laugh> <laugh>. Um, but yeah, absolutely adorable. Um, I also wonder if it, it feels pretty, would it be nice to know that, you know, um, rather than relying on, um, saying like hospital staff and family for help, you know, it, it was also nice to know that, um, someone relied on you and, um, it could have been cat. Yeah, I think that'd be really nice. Um, but yeah, the way, the way you worded that was\\n Really uplifting <laugh>. Um, it was Really nice to hear. Thank you. Thank you for sharing.\\n I have a lot of respect for everything you went through. That sounds like a treasured journey. And, um, I, I know if I were in your position, I don't, I don't think I would be able to, you know, still care for others and, um, you know, put on a constant facade of being all right. Um, so that is, you're definitely very strong for that. Um, and I, it must be extremely hard having, while you're going through your own struggles, your family is too, and though you are helping them, they're, they're never really getting back to you with yours. And it's, it's kind of unfair. I'm not sure how you cope with that, but, um, that is incredibly tough. And I, I hope you give yourself some kindness.\\n Yeah, this is kind of an abstract photo. It's a little confusing, but, um, uh, the focus is on the pedestrian light. Um, it's kind of falling out its socket, um, uh, not socket, but it's, um, place <laugh>. Um, and I took this photo the other night, um, and I, and especially with like the rainy atmosphere, um, this was at like 12:00 AM I'm coming back from school. Um, it, it, it felt, it really evoked a lot of emotion in me. Um, and I think it represented a challenge of going back home, which was, um, just, just realizing how weak I was, especially surrounded by people who were so capable. Um, and, and like the sign I felt as if I was extremely, deeply damaged. Um, and, and so my voice was no longer as strong and that no one would take me seriously. And like, since the sign is kind of falling out, um, it's, it's signal to stop walking and it's not gonna be perceived as strong or that's how I interpreted it.\\n Um, so I didn't feel as I would be listened too seriously and, um, rather I felt powerless and weak. Um, but, you know, like how it's, like how the pedestrian sign is still glowing. Um, it was, it, it was trying really hard to show that it was functional and still working. And, um, that's how I felt as well to there, there was like a strong inherent need to always prove myself to everyone, that I wasn't totally broken and I, I still had some worth. Um, and it, it was, it was a difficult transition cause you know, going home, it, it was really crazy. My family was really disappointed in me now that I was kind of like a damaged good and I wasn't of high value. And I think that was really hard because I, I, I wasn't like, you know, the kid that they wanted me to be.\\n Um, and I think that was really a struggle. So I, I really wanted to prove myself that prove to myself and to them that I was still of some value. Um, but, you know, like having physical weaknesses, you know, like being in for a [inaudible] or having, like, losing so much hair or my teeth, it was, it was a clear sign that, you know, I couldn't cover up that, that I had failed in some ways, even though I didn't like, um, do anything to fail. And it was, it was really hard getting out of this mindset cause it's so incredibly negative. And that was definitely, um, a challenge. Um, but yeah, and a bit different. But, uh, the light also reminded me of, and especially with like, you know, the walk light, how it makes a noise. Um, it reminded me of like the noises, like the beeps and the, the lights that you would see in the hospital.\\n And that, and that's like always a trigger for me. Hearing the repetitive beeping or the flashing lights. Like I, there was never pure darkness and, um, it always invokes the same feeling of helplessness that I felt in the hospital. Um, so that was also a challenge. But one facilitator that, uh, this reminded me of is actually the light. Uh, and being outside, being outside was such a huge benefit to my mental health, I think because just standing in direct sunlight, uh, really helped me feel, um, myself again and made me feel alive. Um, and it was just incredible feeling sun against my skin again. Uh, yeah.\\n Um, yeah, I think it's, it's shifted a lot. I'm not as like, cynical anymore. Um, I, I'd like to like, not view myself as a failure, but um, rather try to recognize the strength that it took to get out of that head space. Um, but it's, it's difficult to remind yourself of that every time. Cause it feels, it doesn't feel genuine. And I think, um, it's hard not to compare to others who, especially my peers. Um, but I am working to get out of that, uh, mindset.\\n Incredibly well said.\\n That was really [inaudible]\\n Yeah, uh, like you said, I, I really have to <laugh>. I'm really taking a lot from what everyone is saying. It's, it's really nice hearing, um, everyone's outlook on this, and especially what you said about the stairs and, um, you know, having the people around you. Uh, it's, it's really, it's really nice seeing, hearing your perspective of how you make accommodations to your needs and like once you come back home. Um, but it's, it's rather inspiring. And, um, thank you for that.\\n I really like what you said, um, about, you know, having people bring stuff and how it makes you feel. Um, I really admire this aspect of you. You always have a way of wording things so artistically, um, and everything that comes outta your mouth is so eloquent, <laugh>. But yeah, I, I definitely think that, um, definitely needs to be some like, reform of the healthcare system, especially. I think these two aspects are the most important. Um, like nutrition and, um, mental health, especially like a follow up. Yes. Um, I would, I would imagine being incre- it would be incredibly hard for people to go back home and, you know, not, not know or not being able to fix themselves up a meal. Um, and yes, they should also do something with the quality of the food. I definitely agree. Um, it's, it, I feel like it even give people like PTSD of, you know, seeing those foods again. Like sometimes I see, um, the cranberry juice that they gave me or, um, you know, the styrofoam plates with, I don't know, I, I always had oatmeal, but it wasn't even oatmeal. It was like water and like four pieces of oats, <laugh>, and, um, the boiled eggs. I just couldn't eat that for like year or so. <laugh>. Yes. So yeah,\\n I think for myself I can say that felt really cathartic.\"}\n",
            "{'participant': 'P2', 'speech': \" Um, oh, yes, thank you, P3. Uh, I, gorgeous picture and really thoughtful in regards to how it affected you and so many of the things, of course, that you shared exactly, exactly what I was feeling or going through at that time. Um, so it was just, I mean, I, I, I really related as well to how you saw yourself or at least saw the, the image and how you were gonna do it. I, it's so funny because when I first looked at it, or when you first were explaining that, I thought, oh, she's gonna run up to that log on its side and have to high jump over it or, and, and then to her future. And so <laugh>, and then when you said, of course, cross it, I thought, oh my God, that looks like a much more sensible way. <laugh>\\n Anyway, though, thank you very much. It was really,\\n Um, sorry. Oh, uh, I, I really liked your picture as well, and, and what you had to say. Um, I also can relate to, I've not checked out that I, that's the first time I've heard of the near I of the near death. Um, you, you're gonna have to repeat it later on, but at any rate, um, it is something I, I, the first time that I was in ICU, um, I ended up having to have heart surgery and part of the whole thing not to be too whatever, is they, they take your heart out for several hours and do their, their thing that they're doing. And so I don't know if that, if that belongs in that category, but, um, it, it, it, I don't think I've been the same since, not necessarily badly, but, but I, I don't also have, it's hard to have people to relate to that experience that, that, um, you know, I mean, it, I've worked at palliative care at the hospital\\n I enjoyed it very much. Um, and I really felt I belong, you know, I had felt I had a good relationship with death. Well, this really changed that. All of a sudden I was afraid of the idea, and it was always there. Um, and yeah, and it, it is hard. At least I believe it's hard for someone who hasn't been in this situation to. So I sure appreciated it. And in regards to that, looking in, standing outside, looking in, uh, that's so often I felt that I can relate to that very much so. Thank you very much. And, and what you had to say really resonated as well. Thanks. Thanks.\\n Um, um, that was kind of beautifully explained, I think, and I, I understand the, that feeling of negativity because, well, yeah. I mean, I revisit that <laugh> more fairly frequently. I, uh, when I was young, my dad had a heart attack, uh, at a very young age. So for whatever reason, that was, you know, it's just sort of been in my, in my head like, uh, oh, you know, I mean, um, I don't know how long I'm gonna be here, sort of thing. And so, uh, as far as being cynical or how, I mean, sometimes I think it's okay to sit in cynicism for a while just to, I don't know. I don't know. Sometimes it can be relaxing, but it's not a good place to stay <laugh>. And by relaxing I just mean, you know, um, those, those thoughts and those that kind of like, oh, what next, you know, sort of thing as I'm familiar with. So anyway, thank you for, thank you for sharing, and it was a great picture.\\n Yeah. Um, I accidentally sent in my, my written stuff too, but at any rate, um, you know, I hope it's not too cliche, but I was just washing dishes and I just kind of, um, noticed the shadow, the, this angel thing in the shadow. And, um, I just thought, geez, that, I mean, that's how I felt was not like an angel. But, um, hiding out in, once I got home, I didn't want to feel, I didn't, I felt really vulnerable. I didn't want to feel vulnerable, um, in front of people, which I've been through before, and it's so stupid. But yet anyway, so it just seemed quite bright out. It wasn't a nice day or anything. Um, but, uh, I, I just like that it's sort of, it, it felt like, kind of like, uh, what my experiences have sort of done to me. Not that I'm isolated. I have a lot of people in my life for sure, but that's that inner time when you don't feel people can relate to what you might have to say, or you don't wanna not burden them. But I don't know, I, I always want to be invisible when I'm really vulnerable. Um, and that's probably not a great trait. But anyway, um, so yeah, I guess it was, that's, that's, that's sort of that.\\n Yeah, definitely. Definitely. That's changed over time. Um, yes, <laugh>,\\n If I, if I put my life into thirds, I've had, uh, at each third I've kind of had a, a fairly dramatic, each time, different, but long, you know, being in the hospital for a month, once it was two months, um, at any rate, lung issues, and then heart issues, and now COPD issues. So the first time I was, I was in, I was gone, you couldn't find me, I, uh, called up my dad and said, dad, I just can't, I thought I could do this, but I, uh, whatever. So I flew home for this healing time and, um, and then, you know, so that's hiding out. And the second time, I, I, I, I had no choice. I didn't, I just had no choice. And so I really appreciated it so much, you know, people helping, um, that, that time. Uh, but I'd say, yeah, I've gotten better, but, um, hopefully there won't be lots of times that that has to happen. Um, but that's definitely, that's me right there not being an angel, clearly.\\n Yeah.\\n Thank you.\\n Thank you.\\n Yeah, that's,\\n That's, uh, that's a great metaphor for sure, for that. Thanks, P3.\\n Oh, thanks, P4\\n Oh, thanks P1.\\n Yeah. For anyone? I'm good to just go along.P3 (00:44:27): Me too.\\n Actually you know, it's also one of those times where what you all said, um, very much what, what I, I really agree with it. I love the picture and I actually, I, I mean, I know that I was having to kind of darken it with my imagination a bit, or, I mean, make it more clear. But I can see that going right up there. It just sort of in that image with the, anyway, beautiful and really cool. I've never experienced that. Um, but it's, it, I love that. I just love, you know, finding those moments and cuz they're there and, and it's, it's great that you, that you can do that and that you do that and you're very eloquent and as well, so I mean.\\n Yes. And sorry about my voice, you guys. I, sometimes it's, anyway, it's getting a little cracky.\\n Got it. I was just trying to say I couldn't hear Facilitator AD\\n Sure. I love Abe, so I mean, thank you. Gorgeous. Um, and I, you know, as soon as you said that, of course, uh, it just resonated, uh, be, I mean, what would I have done if I didn't have my pets? And I always have had, I've been lucky enough that, um, I had a cat for 18 years and then I got another cat for 18 years. Wow. And yeah, so lucky. And there was, there were a dog or two in there, but at any rate, oh, if I didn't have some, we now have a young cat cuz all of our, our other ones have passed away in this past Covid time. Um, but she's just awesome. And like all the animals, like you get home and, uh, that's it. It's just, you know, love there. Nobody's questioning anything, just wanna be in your company. And so that's, uh, that's great. That really resonated with me. Thanks.\\n Yeah, P4. That, that was, um, that was spot on as far as, I mean, I think I'm more selfish than I used to be. And I don't, I mean, the good selfish mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but it's like, that's, I've been a caregiver. That's what, that was my role in the family. That was my role. I remember I, um, anyway, um, not important. Um, but I mean, by family, I mean brothers and sisters and whatnot. And, uh, it just always has been. Those were the, the, um, that, that's, that's, that was a career I went into, and in all manner of different things, but always that, so to, I didn't consider it to be something that would, that I didn't have  you know, the ability to access. So when you say that, I hear it so profoundly, um, not just cuz it's me, but I just felt like what you said was, ugh. Mental hug. <laugh>. Thank you. <laugh>. Oh, teenagers though. Oh, anyways. Thank you. Thank you P4.\\n I'm sorry. Poetic. I mean, like everything that you said, that picture just really, um, reflected everything you were saying, but it looked, it, it was very, very interesting. But you held onto that, um, brightness, you know, like as you said, oh, it's falling out and it's, it's, it's damaged, but there's this whole bright aspect because it's still functioning and being positive and finding that, that, um, hopeful state of mind. I mean, it's tough sometimes, but sometimes you get there and then what, what is it? Um, two steps forward and one step back or whatever. Um, cuz it still keeps coming back if, you know, that's how I feel. I try not to get too, I just always think I'm malleable. I can ban, I can, you know, meanwhile, I'm the same person. I saw Jaws when I was a kid. The movie Jaws I was having, I still have trouble with fresh water, bodies of water, <laugh>. So, I mean, like, it's, it's, it's, it's both. But thank you very much.\\n <laugh>. Okay. Um, um, on the topic of, you know, things that facilitated, things that seemed hard, um, so <laugh>, this is, I'm embarrassed to say these are my front steps and, um, these stairs not very long ago, I mean months ago, were absolutely fine. Um, but, uh, some of this bad weather over the last while and I hadn't been out, um, really taking care of the things and stuff. So anyways, these face facial boards, they also, raccoons got at them. So anyway, the point is <laugh>, they're still completely safe because the weightbearing part of it is all, um, totally sound and fine, but looking at it face forward, it's like, I mean, if all those broken boards were gone, um, you would be completely safe as you walked up. However, that makes, cause nobody's gonna really want to come up to your house. Um, so I kind of felt, when I saw this, I just thought, oh, I don't think I can do this.\\n I don't think I can fix this right now. Or, or if, if at all. Cuz certain things absolutely just win me. And this is the type of stuff that, I mean, I built those stairs years and years ago, but oh my god, I just couldn't even imagine fixing them. So it's a recent problem and I hope in the future to be able to show you all a picture the, of these beautiful steps that are fixed. Anyhow, um, I live in a hundred year old house, lots of, um, uh, little skinny stairwells. Um, and so to come up into my house, it's, I mean I, all of a sudden for the first time it's like, oh wow, I, I, uh, I don't know if I can go up to bed, like up to the bedroom, sort of an attic room, but it's a huge, huge space.\\n Um, but I thought I'm gonna have to go in a bedroom on the main floor I guess or something. And also all of those helpful things like, um, all of a sudden, you know, friends brought over things like, oh, here's this thing you can put in your tub that you can sit on and still hold the shower. Cuz <laugh>, I couldn't do that either. Oh my god. So this is just supposed to represent that, um, uh, there are all these things that can be barriers and will be, or, um, ho- hopefully temporarily, some maybe not. But at any rate, um, this kind of has a, a good enough foundation that I can still get in and out. But, oh, I forgot where I, sorry, I forgot where my train of thought was going. Oh, right. Just these things, like the skinny stairs, having to sit on a stool in the, in the shower for, I don't know, I, I think I had to do that for about a month after I was home, but it, it just seems a lot scarier for the longest time. And it's not that it's not now, you know, but, uh, anyway, come inside the house, that's all <laugh>. That's it.\\n Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It's, um, I, I, I was lucky, um, even though before I went into the hospital, cuz it was a buildup. I was ridiculous. Um, um, my husband was, um, uh, back east visiting his mom for a month. So I started to, I ended up catching pneumonia and it was getting worse. So much so that, well, I would, I would crawl up to my bedroom, no one could see me. So it was okay, but still, I, you know, I didn't get attention and I didn't go for attention, medical attention for way too long. That was so dumb of me. I'm so much smarter that, but anyway, um, when I finally went, my husband was back and, uh, uh, my brother lives with us too, so I mean, uh, whatever. But, um, I just, I went in to take a shower and I couldn't, I could just stop being able to breathe.\\n So I, you know, I yelled for my husband and I, um, uh, anyway, that's the book for, uh, uh, and I kind of made this squeaking noise, like, ah, you know, so that was my second ride in an ambulance. And, uh, it was fun. I mean, they were very nice. I have always had, I, I just, I feel pretty grateful for, um, a lot of the care. You know, I feel like, um, I've been very lucky, you know, in terms of care and, and I love nurses my whole life. Um, you know, my mom was a nurse and her two sisters, my favorite aunts were nurses, cousins, um, my dad's sister, they read the that or teachers and, um, so I mean, I hospital really helps that way for me. I've never, it's just sort of, it, I don't know. Now I'm babbling, that's all. Sorry, <laugh>.\\n For sure. Thanks.\\n Yeah, thank you P3.\\n <laugh>. Thanks P4.\\n No, thank you. Thanks P1.\\n <laugh>.\\n Yeah, <laugh>.\\n <affirmative>,\\n Um, yes, yes. Um, I'm not a nutritionist, um, but hubby did run the Canadian School of Natural Nutrition for a while, so he brings that expertise in actually for, so we've been together 30 years and, um, we've always had a really good diet. It's always like, not that I have anything against restaurants, I love restaurants, but I probably eat at home 95% of the time and, um, uh, you know, pretty good food, fresh vegetables, et cetera. But, and I hope no one can hear me downstairs. Um, my brother came to live with us, uh, some years ago and, um, <affirmative>, anyway, my brother now cooks all the meals and we grew up in a very, um, you know, uh, we, we had to take care of ourselves in a sense, like as, as kids in, in the family I grew up in. So everything was like, you get home for lunch and it's a can of beef stew by God.\\n It was the worst thing ever or a can of something. And so he still eats like this and <laugh> because it was kinda like, look bro, you have to, you have to do something here. That was what it was. And I also recognize that he feels he's, he's being very helpful to me because I have, I have problems with this now, and it's literally just standing as long as you need to stand to, to cook things, I'll still figure out something. But, uh, and I do weekends, but at any rate, so I worry about, I would like to have a dietician come in here and whack him around a bit and say, but he's very, he's, he's been a very big help. So I don't mean, I'm just speaking anyways. I'm with you. Nutrition <laugh>, proper nutrition. Yeah.\\n Yeah. <laugh> already. Excellent thought.\\n Me too. Excellent.\\n No, no. I now <laugh> it was the perfect word for that. I, I'm just gonna think of something that seems like that <laugh> <laugh>. Um, enlightenment.\\n Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.\"}\n",
            "{'participant': 'P5', 'speech': \" <laugh>.\\n Thank you so much, P3. It's a beautiful picture. Um, and you know, I know you very well. I know your story, but it's always nice to, to hear it back. Um, and, uh, when I saw the picture, first of all, I love it. It's, it's beautiful. I saw the log as well being the obstacle, and you explained it very well, but then it also struck that it's like a rebirth, right? Like when, uh, tree falls, it actually blends with the ground, and then some mushrooms come out of it and some mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah, <laugh>.\\n <laugh>. And then I also thought of the road, and actually my picture you'll see is also about the road. So I think we all see that there's a, a transition in a journey that starts, uh, after we leave the ICU.\\n \\n I agree with everyone. I think, uh, this is a great message and such a visual way to express what you went through. Um, I could relate to the near death experience. I think I've lived it, not in the context I think of being in the ICU, but just in, in very stressful times in my life, actually, my brother as well was in the ICU. So that was a, a very stressful time. Um, and like you said, to talk about it, to maybe find people that you can have this exchange is very, very beneficial. Um, and maybe when that happened, it was bringing you to a new frequency, a new, like, you're expanding, right? You're evolving as a person, and then the, the analogy of the window is like, you're just somewhere else in a way, and it's trying to reconnect with, with people. Um, so I'm sure it was very difficult for you to just go through physically what you went through, but also in the mental way, uh, what, what you've gone through and the experience itself. So thank you for sharing this picture. Thanks.\\n Thank you so much, P1. This was a great picture, and it, it really touched me, uh, for many reasons. I spoke a bit about my brother, that he was in icu and it happened when he was 16 years old. Um, I'm not sure when it happened to you, but it was in that critical time where it was about his friends. And so I can completely relate. I can understand what you went through. Um, at the same time, like anything, I think life sometimes throws, you know, curve balls at us to rise above that and actually find happiness. Um, and this could be so easy to say, but same time for a child or a person of that age, you had a lifetime that you lived in a small period. So it gives you that wisdom and way to evolve that, you know, there's no price for that. So, in a way, maybe this is the gratitude that, you know, as you go through this, uh, through your life, maybe the gratitude will come more and more in that, in that way. Um, but I can relate to you so much. Yeah, that was really kind.\\n <laugh>,\\n Thank you so much, P2. I love, uh, your image and your analogy and, and what you, how you're processing it. Um, and maybe the common theme and, and the stories that we just heard is it's all a question of not feeling like you're relating to anyone, uh, through your illness and what you've gone through. Um, and to maybe have that inner world that we may have found at the ICU  I know for me, this is what actually brought me to get out of it in a, in a positive way, but I think it's introspection and to that we all come stronger with time. Um, and if you've lived it three times, you're a warrior. <laugh>.\\n Thank you for sharing.\\n Okay. So, um, initially I was planning on sharing with you guys a picture of our Christmas tree, um, and all the ornaments in it because it reminded me of, you know, the homecoming, um, and the gratitude, you know, being around the people that I love and just being, you know, back home. Um, also the ornaments talking about my life, like really, we put everything from our, the birth of my first baby to a mountain that we just visited. Like, it's just a story of our life. So I figured the tree was just representing my experience, uh, through, through the ICU. And then yesterday, um, it was a hectic day and I was just, uh, with my, my youngest daughter, she was napping in the car, and I was waiting for my eldest. And then <inaudible>, I decided to just go for a nice drive around the lake where, where we live.\\n And I had just a moment of just, again, feeling grateful because through my experience, it unleashed a lot of beautiful things in my life because I had to rediscover who I was, and it gave me a lot of strength and to move even to the Laurentian’s, which is where we live now, in the mountains. Um, so as I was driving, um, the sunset just, you know, appeared on this picture, but it's hard for you maybe to see, but it, it was actually, it's called a  crepuscular sunset. So where you see the sun, there's, it was actually a beam going all the way up to the sky. Um, it's, it was hard. It's hard to sound the picture, but it, it really happened. And I never seen that in my life. Um, it was a moment of like, oh my God, this, I'm meant to be this at this particular time, and all the experiences of my life, including the ICU, just, you know, it's part of my, my journey.\\n Um, also this picture represents, you know, the obstacle, the fact that there's trees there, going to maybe the, the journey of being back home and being in a safe place. There was still hurdles to go through, which was, you know, uh, like everyone is saying, just being back in the pace of life. I had my youngest baby that was just 13 months that I had to take care of. I had no energy. So there was still some obstacles in front of me, but there was that beam right there, and I was just keeping an eye on that, uh, mentally. Anyways, so when I took the picture, five minutes later, I'll show you guys. I was driving, I don't know if you can see, but two deers appeared on the road.\\n Yes, it's a video. Yes, I'll send it to a new, it just confirmed that this moment in time had to happen, and, you know, we have to accept things that ha that are negative and just keep on going, basically.\\n Yes, um, it actually brings me to the next picture. So there was a lot of support, right, uh, from my family, uh, nutrition wise, uh, making sure that there was meals for me, um, and just telling them like, listen, I really can't walk. I can't do anything like being very vocal about my capacities, but at the same time, setting small steps every day, um, to walk further and, and faster and kind of like self-motivate. But through that process, I felt very alone, very, very alone. And you wanna show that you're strong and that you have it, everything, you know, all together. But in reality, I was far from it. And three months later, that's when my, you know, post, uh, ICU episode happened. And I think this is, was probably the compound of showing how strong I was and how I was able to do everything.\\n Thank you. Thank you, P4.\\n <laugh>. Thank you P1. If I can add, it's all over us. I think it's just tuning in into those, those gifts that we have every day.\\n Yep.\\n We, I'm good. \\n <laugh>. If this adorable is like a little fluff ball. I wish I could just sleep on him. Was he a pillow?\\n Yeah. Aw. Oh. But it reminds us of like the simple things, right? That you're maybe more in tune after the ICU on the needs that you have and the simple need of having comfort and maybe even affection from your pets, and then maybe the people around you. I know for me, I was more open to touching, uh, people around me, uh, after I think it kind of cut a barrier that I maybe had before. Um, so very lucky that you have a little football. I wish I could have one. We have a parrot as you know. So Yeah, <laugh> another kind of cuteness <laugh>.\\n One day. Oh yeah, <laugh> so cute. He actually will fluff up. That's what, if he sees the cat is gonna, is gonna go like this. So, and you actually have the same color. Too gray.\\n Thank you so much, P4, for sharing. You should be very, very proud of yourself for the degree of introspection that you have with how you've gone through the whole experience. What are your challenges? Most people are not even there. They're, they're maybe losing themselves, especially with all the appointments. And, and so at the same time that facade is there, you're still living and being aligned with how you feel now. There's a lot of energy that you're actually putting into that mask. And maybe with time to shift it to go more into this self care and, and opening up, uh, we'll get you to heal even more. Thank you for sharing.\\n Thank you so much, P1. Um, I love what you just said in the picture. Uh, it just reminded me how vulnerable we were through the ICU. Um, and specifically when, you know, being that you're very young, you must have felt even more bare. Like as we age, we define ourselves more, we know who we are. But imagine going through that at that age and already not having that of an identity maybe, and then going through such a, a vulnerable time, um, could be difficult. But the same time it's a stepping stone to break free, break free of maybe what your family's expecting from you and then create something extraordinary, uh, in your own terms. You mentioned also mindset, and it reminds me of when I was in the ICU, how there was a shift that happened. Um, I was going through a lot of stress right before my, my septic shock. And, um, when I, I found gratitude, I shifted everything. And then after my whole life kind of like shit like Kaleidoscope, everything turned in a different direction. Uh, so maybe to going back to that and going, okay, I'll start with my mindset and just kind of let things flow in that same direction.\\n You're very mature and thank you for sharing.\\n Thank you P2. Um, I feel that it shows that you're very resilient. I mean, what, you've gone through the three major events of your life and maybe the stairs representing the hurdles that you went through and that it, you're still solid, you're still there and, and the steps also of your recovery, uh, back home. Uh, so thank you for sharing\\n On my picture as if you, um, facets to it. Um, it's a closeup of my Tupperwares <laugh>. I dunno if, I mean, I'm really into Tupperwares. I'm a dietician. So for me it's like they gotta be filled with food. Um, and obviously when I came back, that was the last thing. I was not organized. And, and, um, that was my barriers was, is to really have, you know, nourishing foods available to me. Now I expressed it and I had all the support in the world, but that made me reflect how for a lot of people, this is not possible. They don't have the means, they don't have the support. Um, and if anything, whenever we come out of the ICU  it's all about nourishment in all aspects, mentally, physically. I mean, for sepsis it's very important to have, you know, high protein and high calorie foods. But unfortunately my appetite was at zero. Like, it was so difficult to even put anything in. Um, so that inspired me to first of all cope with that and, and really work through my, uh, my problem of appetite, but also to eventually be becoming a patient partner and working on, you know, nutrition and, and sepsis and creating, uh, maybe some tools on the long term to help, uh, survivors, uh, in terms of their diets. So this has a few facets. Um, and definitely nutrition is a huge role whenever we come outta the ICU. Yeah.\\n Yes. So I was lucky to have a few freezers filled just randomly <laugh> when I came back. So there was a few meals there, but I was still lucky. Like my family, my aunts, my uncles, uh, my friends, they all came food. And uh, I had my two freezers filled to the brink for the good month and a half after. So good. Yes. Excellent. But like I was saying, that really made me realize how it's not the situation that most people come home to mm-hmm. <affirmative> and that may, you know, explain why the recovery is so hard. Right. Nutrition is the base of everything.\\n <laugh>?\\n Excuse me for just one moment. Sorry. Yeah, I'm just, go on.\\n Yeah, this see, this is all part of maybe the resources that should be automatically given to any ICU survivor. Um, and to have something in place, even like when you do a follow up in the community, like what's your support in terms of nutrition and so on. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it reminds me of when also when I was in the ICU how the food was not adequate at all. And my husband was always coming with, uh, sushi or even he wanted, wanted to do a candlelight dinner. I'm like, no, you don't do that in the ICU, like\\n But I just to say, you know, hospital food is, is what it is. And, and people have to think outside the box and research and, you know, add basically to, to their diet. So nice that your dietician.\\n You were mentioning the mental health, um, intertwined with eating, but we're realizing more and more that mental health is linked to our gut health. Um, so maybe eventually a, again, ICUs could really focus on nourishing the gut so that we come out also better and more resilient and have less of the trauma afterwards. So lots of work to be done in that field.\"}\n",

So why don't we actually take two minutes If you wanna grab a glass of water, take a little stretch break, come back in two minutes. All right? Okay. Yeah, thank you.

We both went and got peppermint tea right before our session. Oh, okay. Um, so, so I think we're gonna, so we're gonna proceed in the same order again. Um, and do the second, um, the second question. And I think what I'm gonna do is, um, we're actually doing pretty good on time, so we'll, we'll see how things go if I need you to wind it up. Why don't I do this? Okay. This is your 10 like wrap up in about 10 more seconds. There you go. How does that look? Okay. Yeah. And then I, like I said, if you have more to say, say, and we don't have time for it, please just chat, chat, chat, and type in the chat. Excellent. So we are back over to P3 and Facilitator FH is gonna bring up your image and what were challenges and facilitators to this transition. Oh, she's so sweet.\n",

            " Yeah. And the cat can't sign the consent form. So Yeah, you have to have, uh, you have to have the human around. Yeah. It's a lovely photo, um, of, of your, your facilitator, uh, to your, to, to your recovery. And, um, you know, totally relate to that. Uh, was I, how did it feel to be without in, I mean, in the hospital, like you had realized, yeah,\n",
            " You, have some comfort.\n",
            " Thanks Yeah. Thank you so much.\n",
            " Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's definitely see some nods, <laugh>. Yes. And yeah, we'll go over to P4.\n",
            " Thank you. <laugh> and P1.\n",
            " Thank you, P1. Over to P2.\n",
            " Thank you. And we'll move forward to P5\n",
            " Excellent. Thank you so much. Um, so we will move on to P4. And this is your barriers and facilitators. Excellent.\n",
            " Thank you, P4. And just to let you know that we will be addressing mental health, um, in a later session, I think not next week, but the week after. So we'll be talking more extensively. Um, may I ask you a follow up? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> question. Um, I'm just wondering, so you talk about this mask that you had to put on and you had to be okay for your, you know, your immediate family and your, and sort of whole things together. Did you have moments where it was okay to, to just feel what you were feeling?\n",
            " And at this point, does your family even realize that, or is the, that mask still in place?\n",
            " Thanks for sharing. I'm gonna turn it over to, P1, to start us off.\n",
            " Thanks P1. And we'll move on to P2.\n",
            " Thank you. And over to P3.\n",
            " Thank you. Okay, so now we're gonna move on to P1's photo. So challenges and facilitators.\n",
            " Thank you P1. It sounds like, um, yeah, taking things for granted like sunlight and then you sort of rediscovering that for your, for yourself. I just wanted to dial back a little bit. Um, so you talked a a lot about like, expectations of your family and the people around you and feeling like a failure. Can I, can I ask, like, do you still feel that same way today? Has that shifted a lot for you? Or is this something you're working on?\n",
            " Thank you, P1. I'm gonna throw it over to P2.\n",
            " Thanks P2. Well go to P5.\n",
            " Thank you. And over to P3.\n",
            " Thank you. Hey, and we are gonna move on to P2.\n",
            " It's just taking a minute, aren't we doing it says your screen. Yeah, it says your screen share. It's just taking a minute. There we go. Okay.\n",
            " <laugh>. Thanks P2. So I'm wondering what it feels like that when, so you're saying you come back from the hospital and these things, like the stairs is insurmountable. What is it like when you're actually, you make it up the stairs or you don't have to sit on the little stool? Um, because I'm sure it probably feels like you're gonna have to be on the stool forever, right?\n",
            " All good, P2, thank you P5.\n",
            " Thank you. Over to P3.\n",
            " Thank you. Okay, so we're gonna move on to P5\n",
            " Thank you so much for that. Um, so knowing your background that you are indeed a nutritionist, um, I'm just wondering, did you, did people cook for you or did you order, order in healthy food? Like how did you, how did you manage that whole, whole nourishment?\n",
            " Thank you for that. And we will go to P3 first\n",
            " <laugh>. Excellent. We'll go to P1 and then P2. Mm-hmm.\n",
            " Definitely. Thank you P2.\n",
            " Thank you. It's amazing how food connects us or can disconnect us from our experiences. Just because we have a couple minutes, I'm gonna share with you that, um, I, when I was in my hospital stay, which we've all talked about, um, I couldn't eat. I was so nauseous, couldn't keep anything down and didn't want to eat. So again, the dietician came to see me and, and told me, you know, we're gonna get creative and send you some good food. And that night she sent me the stinkiest fish. I opened up like the, the dome, the, and I was just like, yeah, like there's no way. And I still like, I'll still cook fish every once in a while, but I was on a business trip with my boss and a couple people and we went to this restaurant and it was all fish and I had to proceed with caution because I still like, think of that smelly, nasty fish <laugh> from Y and yeah, like, I, I so agree.\n",
            " Like the little bits on your plate kind of thing. Um, I just wanted to say that really lovely discussion and I just love watching how you're all supporting each other and lifting each other up. Cuz I know we are, we are talking about hard things and as we go through the weeks, um, the topics get a little, a little bit more heavier, but also a little bit more hopeful too. I'm hoping that there will be, um, some hope as we proceed through the weeks. So, um, I was gonna give us extra space to have some discussion, but you were already having such lovely discussion. So I think what we'll do right now is we will show you your next assignment.\n",
            " So this next assignment is all about organization and technology. So what did you do to organize and adapt your life in your home at first and what you're doing now or what's ongoing for you and what did you or your family and your family need at home at first and ongoing. So that's what we're gonna focus on for next week, sort of the organization of your home, the setup of your home, however you wanna interpret those questions. Any questions. And I believe Facilitator FH, you're gonna send out the questions and reflection sheets and everything after, after, um, our meeting today.\n",
            " Yeah. And I, I can send out the same sheets that you have, but I'll just embed the questions in them just so it's for ease of use. Um, and like you've all done this pastime, feel free to interpret, combine, um, you know, take photos and speak to the aspects that resonate with you. Mm-hmm. This is really an exploration of what, what's important for, for you. And, um, and we're learning from you. Uh, we may have these guiding questions, but um mm-hmm. <affirmative>, there's stuff that's missing from them too, right? So feel free\n",
            " To Absolutely.\n",
            " To um, be as creative as you'd like with the questions.\n",
            " We all got quiet all of a sudden.\n",
            " Ah-huh <laugh>. Excellent. So don't forget, I've got a couple of reminders. Don't forget to upload or email your photos at least an hour before the next session. You can email either of us if you're stuck, you need help. Um, if anything was distressing, please reach out. Um, yeah, as we check out, maybe what we can do is describe today's session for you in one word. So who would like to start?\n",
            " I love that.\n",
            " Because you love it. P2, you're going next.\n",
            " Enlightenment. Thank you.\n",
            " Thankful.\n",
            " And I'm gonna jump into and just say, um, I gonna do two words admiration for the bravery that you have to talk from the heart, um, about such, you know, really tough stuff and gratitude that you are showing up here for yourselves and for each other and, um, for being willing to share. Thank you.\n",
            " I don't know what I could say after all. Hearing all of this, I think I'm really excited to see how this group is forming and moving through these exercises and, um, seeing the commonalities and the differences that are coming out. But I just wanted to say thank you for sharing of yourselves. This is not easy to do and here we are in a Zoom environment. Um, but you're trusting in us. You're trusting in each other. Um, and with that, I will wish you a wonderful week. \n",
            "P3\t Okay. So I went out with an idea in mind of a photo that I wanted to take. It was of a road, actually, just the road. Cause that's why I felt like it was, the journey behind me was a road and the journey, another long road. And then as I was coming, this was taken at the park. And as I was coming outta the park off to my right, I saw this and I just like almost slammed on the brakes. Unfortunately, nobody was behind me. I had to get off the side of the road. It just spoke to me. So I just got very emotional because the whole time I've been thinking about what did I want this photo to be, et cetera, et cetera. And it just spoke to me about the fact that it was like I was having to cross from one point to another.\n",
            " I was leaving the safety of the hospital and then to kind of an unknown. The picture, represents the unknown on the other side, and it's almost a bit of a hill. And, and at the same time, that log is covered in moss. So to transfer that log could be dangerous, could be scary. And how I felt not leaving the safety net of the hospital, given the fact that the night before I had quite an event where I almost passed out in the bathroom and they still sent me home the next morning. I was very apprehensive about that transition home and the fear of landing. And, and that's one of the post long haul symptoms I've had, is that living with that fear of getting, for my case, it was again, getting sick again and ending up back in hospital and experience that all over again. So that's what that kinda represents to me. Um, yeah, like it just spoke out to me and I just had to take the  photo. It was such a pleasure to do this. Like, it was like, wow, I gave lots of time to think. Do you want me to go through the questions?\n",
            "\n",
            " Well, I did have pictures of the road where I actually stood, I making sure there no traffic. And I got middle of the road and great. And I was happy with that. I, that's my photo. I can speak to that then\n",
            " Driving back. This just, I don't know, there's just something about, it spoke out to me.\n",
            " Yes.\n",
            " Um, yeah, I mean, my hospital stay was 58 days long, so it was a long, long recovery for me. And I was going home with still existing problems. I was not a hundred percent recovered. I was facing the likelihood of another major surgery, which I did have, but, put off for at least another year. Cause I was just too terrified to go back and have more surgery. Um, but, and also just that fear of, um, I knew that there was some risk factors associated with being back at home and fear of would I ever get back to myself again? Because I was like, I mean, I was using a walker. I could barely, I needed help to shower. I needed help to, like, I was far from the person I was before I got ill. Far from, there was a lot of anger in the hospital when about that too. Um, but, so it was, it was definitely a fearful time.\n",
            " Hi, P4. Um, I, um, I didn't have an ND yeah, I was near death, but, and had to be a lot of things done. But, um, if anything, you know what? I take some comfort in hearing what you just have to say because you had an ND which meant you, you got a glimpse into what is beyond what we experience here. And the fact that you said you didn't wanna come back must mean that it's an amazing, beautiful place. So thank you for sharing that. I look for, I'd like to hear your story. I feel sad that you can't share that with your family, um, and feel that you could be heard and understood. Um, so, um, my ears are open. My heart is open with an intention of understanding, if you ever wanna share it with somebody. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.\n",
            " It's, you know, I was very fortunate. I had people that couldn't fully understand all I went through, but were there with me every day and watching, and, you know, many, many days in the hospital in a long recovery. So, um, but, um, your picture is very, um, touching and I, I hope you find some comfort and is able, you're able to let that guilt you feeling go as well. Thank you. Life is good. Enjoy <laugh>, you know, find the gratitude and the fact that you are here and, and, uh, you'll be there. You get to, you will get there again. Yeah, we don't know where and when, but yeah.\n",
            " I think P5 almost kind of summed what I was going to say. You are a very smart, articulate, insightful young woman, P1. And your picture and what you saw in that photo and how you were able to relate it is astounding. You're, you know, somebody of your age, and I think very P5 said, you're an old soul now. You've experienced something that most people don't go through. I know, I know there's always lots of young children critically on that, but that will give you an opportunity and lens at life that is gonna be so much more different than that of your peers. And the fact that, you know, yeah, I can't imagine I'm, you're going, I, I can't imagine coming out and that age particularly and seeing everyone going on. And that's an age where people won't stop to wanna really engage and understand where you're coming from. Cause life is twofold for them. But, um, I think that, um, over time, those friendships, if they sustain and carry on for many, many years, that you'll be able to share it on a much different level with them moving forward. And, um, yeah, thank you for sharing that. Cause you know, we relate to our experiences, and I was an older lady when it happened. Not that old clarify that\n",
            " But I just thank you for sharing.\n",
            " Sorry, I go off and on on my muting. So, um, lovely photo. And it could get, um, yeah, like we all had that period that who's gonna understand this and, and wanting to, and I remember days wanting to just kinda curl up in my room, but you used the word vulnerable, and I know that resonated with me because I was used to being the caregiver, um, as the retired nurse. So, um, and then having to rely on others to care for me, and not being able to do the simplest of tasks in my home. I couldn't, like I said, I had to have a family member that basically happy, had to work, he had to get back to work. I mean, he did while I was hospitalized, um, and a sister that put her life on hold because I needed full-time care at the home when I was discharged.\n",
            " And that's, that was hard. That's a very vulnerable place to be in and to have to rely on others. And a very, at times, as much as you were joyful, full of, thank God I'm home and I'm on the mend , and I'm, I can, I will get better. I just had to keep telling yourself that It was times where, yeah, it was a dark kinda lonely place that you just felt like you just wanted to stay in the shadows, and you just wanted that, I don't know what I would call it. Just time to grieve. That's what it was.\n",
            " Yeah,\n",
            " And I bet you are an angel,\n",
            " I love the picture, P5. That's gorgeous. And I keep my eye up for those kinda sunsets. I don't know any of you guys here. Most of us here I think are on the west Coast. Oh my God. We were treated to a stunning sunset last night, like just raising red. It was nothing like I've ever seen before, so probably should have run out and taken a picture of that. But anyhow, um, yeah, and I think it's like, um, you know, um, it was just spoke to and, and to think that, you know, like there, you know, the barriers that were in front of you, yet there was something beautiful behind those barriers that, you know, to look forward to. And I knew for you, you're beautiful children and your young family, and were, were such, um, motivators. And, um, yeah. So thank you. Lovely picture.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " It's a he by the way.\n",
            " Yeah, that is, uh, Abe, his actual name, his registered name was Honest Abe. But we just call him Abe or Abert, and you about facilitators. He was in my recovery and one of the first things I couldn't to get home too, I mean, I saw my husband in the hospital. I had my sister, my son was visiting, friends, came to visit. But this love of my life here, my poor baby. At one point we talked about them bringing him into the hospital, but he's, um, he is pretty stressed out when he rides in the car. He doesn't like riding the carrier. So I didn't wanna put him through that. But, um, so, and it was, um, interesting. I couldn't wait to see him as we walked through the doors. I came in through the garage cause I, I had to hold onto walls and things to get into the house.\n",
            " He was having what he has like asthma and asthma attacks. So it wasn't quite the welcoming I was expecting. And then he ignored me for about 10 minutes and I was heartbroken, what do you mean? And then from there on in, he was my shadow and he still is. So, um, he played a big role and just like that was something normal. That was something important for me to get home to, um, that I couldn't have while I was in recovery while I was [inaudible] in the hospital. So he was one of my biggest facilitators. I guess the big thing missing is the other people in my life, but, um, printer's not working. And the biggest one, I mean, I have my husband here, but my sister will be huge role, but she in prints ever dial in to get the consent forms and everything's fine. Would've been just too much of a hassle. So, but so that's missing from this photo. But, um, yeah, he is, uh, pets give that unconditional love. And so for those times, feeling like nobody understood and nobody could, you know, not that I had that experience too much, but it was just there in my face constantly. So he's my love, one of them. Sorry Rob. My husband's on the couch, so I gotta make sure he hears that.\n",
            " Understand. He says <laugh>.\n",
            " I worried about him, because he is mine. You know, like it cats little attached to, and, and, and there were days where my husband, once he got back to work, um, he'd be out of the house at five in the morning and then he worked, I was ended up transferring to, um, [hospital]. But, um, so my husband would be out of the house from five in the morning and after his day of work come to the hospital every day, he never missed a day to come see me, ever. Oh. Ever, ever. And so he would be getting home some nights at, I'd be kicking him out at 6 30, 7 at the hospital saying, you gotta go home. So that's cat spent hours and hours alone. So I worried about him. So yeah. So <laugh>, it was a good thing to get home to him knowing that he would have somebody around\n",
            " Yeah, and my sister was here. She was back and forth and she'd come faithfully every day she'd get up. And for somebody that lives in small Prince  Rhode Island, having to drive from [city] to harassments every day was a nerve-wracking experience. But she did it. And, uh, so she was out of the house a lot, but she did her best to comfort him while I wasn't. Yeah.\n",
            " Hospitals do allow pet visits now. So I think that's something we should be encouraging.\n",
            " He stays there. He, he likes to get up right up here\n",
            " We'll have to put them together. P5\n",
            " Thanks\n",
            " I hope I can talk without crying. <laugh>\n",
            "\n",
            " But like P5, I hope at some point in time that you'll feel maybe some vulnerability to share with your family, some of what you've been feeling as they progress. I don't know how long ago you were sick and where everybody is, if it's still too soon. But I think that that's an important thing for you to be able to move forward and to, um, be okay with not being okay because, um, yeah. And that's for Smokey. Yeah, actually, that song hits lots for me. I spent my entire life dealing with obesity and tracks of my tears are a song that speaks a lot to living life and putting on faces that you're okay and you're fine. So, um, but it's like P5 says, hopefully you can let that mass go sometimes and feel safe or find a group or people that you can, and hopefully we're one of them right now, but others in your real life and reach out to somebody. Do you have a siblings that you could, like you talked about a sister that has had a shared experience.\n",
            " Yeah. Cause she's had an severe illness that maybe, you know, she's one that you could share, like you guys could find some common ground with and, you know, but yeah. Thank you for sharing that. Yep.\n",
            " Thank you for sharing. That picture was beautiful. Yeah, it, it really speaks to so much.\n",
            " Exactly. Very mature. And maybe there, that is something that came out of your experience, right? A maturity that probably isn't seen amongst your peers, I'm sure of it. Um, I shouldn't say that, but you, you bring a different perspective. And I'm just curious some of the wording that you use, damage goods and, and not being that if, if it's often our own perceptions that get in our way versus with was were your parents genuinely feeling that way or were they just, you know, um, that we put a lot on ourselves and they are our barriers and, and I know from me in recovery sometimes that was a barrier because of expectations or thoughts that I thought of where I should be and wasn't, or could be and wasn't. Um, so, but um, the, your ability to take a picture like that when I first thought I thought, what is she going to be speaking to in this picture?\n",
            " Like, or I guess it was like my first one. Some of you thought, what has that got to do with? And, and then you so eloquently defined it. And, um, you know, and, and that even in our dysfunctional states, we are still as valuable and always will be. And that light was still there as you noted. And that can very quickly be fixed. You know, it'll take somebody to come along and put that back up. So that, that is a working functional piece. And, and that's what happens to us in our recovery pieces. People help to put it back together. We put it back together. And maybe it's not gonna look perfect to need a repair though, but it's still is a very valuable asset and safety of people walking down that street. So thank you for sharing it.\n",
            " I love the photo. That is a beautiful shot. And if anything, it's an inviting photo. I wanna go up those stairs. I wanna, I, they don't scare me. Cause if you look to the other side, I wanna go up those stairs and go through that door. Cause what's beyond that door. And I think that, um, you kinda captured, and I'm hoping P1 takes from this, that even though things are broken, they're just fine and there's beauty in both and that they're still functional, they're still doable, they're still, and look that they welcome you into something further. So I think it was a beautiful photo and a good way to, like, stairs are a barrier. I was lucky I came home for one level home cause I could never have managed stairs. I don't know what I would've done. I don't know what we would've done if I'd had to manage stairs to come home. We've had to arrange ambulance transport and have them carrying up the stairs because there's no way I could have done it. I was so physically, physically impossible to do that. I know that. So thank you for sharing.\n",
            " What can I say that a picture of food? How surprising was that?\n",
            " Um, absolutely. And you know, it, it is multicomplex because you speak to, you also spoke to the fact that for many, you have to rely on others to do that for you.\n",
            " Okay. Hope he's okay. Um, mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. So, and, um, well aware, uh, that, uh, that was a big part of my recovery as well so long and having to reintroduce food back into my diet and, and that loss of appetite. It's probably one of the only few times in my life I didn't have an appetite. Um, um, no, I think it's, um, it's just, uh, one of the facets, like you spoke to the fact that, and how it's led you to taking something negatively that happened to you and turning it into something so positive. So positive. Thank you.\n",
            " Thankful.\n",
            "P4\t Yeah. So first off, P3, I amazing photo and I so can relate to what you're talking about and had many of the same feelings and concerns that you did. And, you know, when you were describing it and you were describing your photo and how it spoke to you, it, it did really, you know, evoke a lot of emotion, uh, in me because, um, yeah, it, it's very, very, very close to the heart. So, um, thank you for sharing and that is a, a really, really good photo. Thank you.\n",
            " Uh, no, let's, let's do the other one first, if that's okay. I think. Yeah.\n",
            " No, no, that's fine.\n",
            " So I can, I think, oh, yeah.\n",
            " So, I think I kind of approached it a little differently. I kind of lumped the question altogether in one. So I think really both of my photos kind of speak probably to both aspects, but this more to the first question. And I also didn't do the, um, reflection questions individually. I kind of read them and thought about them and then kind of lumped it in. And I, I did write something. I just, I'm less nervous than I do better <laugh> if I have something written out. So I'll just go through and, and kind of wrote, uh, what I wrote about this. So this was called on the outside looking in. And what I wanted to capture in this image is that that's really how I felt when I returned home from the hospital. Um, my life had been so profoundly changed. I didn't really know, you know, who I was, how I fit in, how I was gonna move forward and everything around me.\n",
            " You know, my family, like, they all just kept going. And I really did feel like, you know, I was on the outside looking in on all the activity and everything that was going on. Um, everyone was happy and they were very alive and doing everything they normally do. Um, my kids were going to all their activities and my husband's going to work, and, you know, my parents were luckily here. Um, but I didn't feel that way and I didn't feel that they understood, you know, what I had been through and how it had affected me. And I think one of the things that affected me most deeply during my experience was I actually did have a near death experience. And, you know, I don't know if anybody else had that and if they might be willing to share after I, I would be curious to know.\n",
            " But, uh, that was very, very, uh, it was a very life altering and profound experience, but I had absolutely nobody that I could talk to about that. I didn't feel that I could share it with anybody. I was worried people wouldn't understand. They wouldn't believe me. I was worried. They might think I was, you know, a little bit crazy. Um, I felt really alone, really isolated. So I did a lot of research, uh, you know, on the internet. I got lots of books from the library. I probably read five or six books, uh, about near death experiences. And through that I found the Near Death Experience Research Foundation. It's the NDEFR. And their website was really valuable to me. You actually can post, uh, your experience and they do, uh, publish it online. And so it just allowed validation for me of my experience and made me feel like I wasn't alone in that.\n",
            " And, um, that was really the therapeutic to be able to share. And I also felt, I guess, a little bit guilty because part of, there was a part of me that, you know, when I was going through that didn't want to come back and to have felt that way. And then to be back, you know, I felt guilty, you know, every, all anyone said to me, I, I couldn't complain about anything. I couldn't complain about how I was feeling because all I would get is, well, you're alive. You, you're not dead. You're alive. You should be happy that you're alive. And I, I just, um, I felt guilty, I guess, for not feeling happy that I'd survived, because now I was living with all the pain and the life altering ramifications of what had happened. And I really felt like I was standing on the outside looking in, and that nobody really could understand or help me.\n",
            " <affirmative>? Oh, no, we don't know. No. Oh,\n",
            "\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " Not, not a lot. I mean, I have, I have shared it with, uh, a few friends, but again, I mean, unless you've really experienced that and you've been through that, I mean, I, I don't think people really do understand or can understand. Um, you know, I haven't shared it with, you know, my parents or, or anybody. I briefly kind of alluded to it with my husband, but I don't know. He's, he's very factual and, and very matter of fact. And, uh, he's, he's a surgeon physician himself. And so, you know, he just, he sees, you know, he just says, well, I just see the worst of the worst and nothing phases me. And, you know, he just doesn't really have a lot of, I guess, empathy or sympathy or understanding along those lines. But yeah,\n",
            " Thank you.\n",
            " Thanks, P3. Thank you for sharing, P1. That was, that was very, very touching. And I, I really love the phrase that you use, that you're not alone, but you're lonely. And that really resonated with me. Um, so true. But, uh, I really, yeah, it was, it was beautiful. So thank you for sharing.\n",
            " Yeah, a great photo. I just, the, just the way the angel is in the corner with the shadows, um, really, really great. And I, I pretty much could reiterate exactly what P3 just said. Um, you know, I, I too am in the healing profession. I'm a giver. It was really, really hard to be on the other end of that, and having to accept help and having to learn how to accept help, and also wanting to just at times become invisible and just, you know, stay in bed and not get up, but just having to sort of charge forward and move on and, and, uh, so absolutely. Great. That was great photo. Thank you.\n",
            " Beautiful picture. And P5, I just wanna say, um, I just, I love your positivity and I love your, you have a real gift at just being able to listen to what people are saying and then really having that nice, positive, encouraging, uplifting spin. So I, I really appreciate that about you. And, and it's, it's really lovely. Thank you.\n",
            " I'm good.\n",
            " Gorgeous cat. Uh, I do not have a pet. Um, I kind of wish that I did. I have three teenage boys instead, and I probably would've gotten more, um, comfort and sympathy and, uh, attention from a, from a cat or a dog, uh, than my three teenage boys. But that's what it is.\n",
            " And again, like I said, I I kind of just meshed both the questions together, <laugh>, so mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, so I'll, I'll, I'll try. But, um, the title of this one is The Tracks of My Tears. And really it was inspired by the song by Smokey Robinson. And for those of you that aren't familiar, I won't, I won't sing it, but I'll just, uh, say a line, um, take a good look at my face. You'll see my smile looks out of place. And if you look closer, it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears. And I think one of the hardest things in coming home was I was feeling so vulnerable and just crushed and feeling my emotions were all over the place. But, you know, the second that I stepped out of the car to make my way into the house, I felt like I had to put a mask on.\n",
            " Um, I had to put on my brave face, and I didn't feel that I was allowed to show, um, what I was really experiencing. Um, a lot of that was just my, my need to feel like I had to protect everybody around me. That I had to put their emotions and their feelings and their needs above mine, even though I was in such a low place. And, um, my parents were flying out from Nova Scotia on the day that I, you know, went into, uh, severe medical distress and ended up, you know, in the ICU. Um, but they had no idea because they were coming. I was supposed to have knee surgery three days later, so they were coming for my knee surgery. And they didn't know until they landed at the airport that everything had gone sideways. And that, um, you know, things had gotten really bad and my mom didn't cope very well.\n",
            " Um, my sister had ended up in the ICU several years ago when she had my niece with sepsis, which I know many of you can, uh, relate to, and, you know, almost died. And my mom never really recovered from that. I think she had a lot of PTS D. So when she found out that, you know, what had happened to me, uh, she really wasn't co coping well. And so I was more worried about how everybody else was doing. Um, so, you know, my kids were really traumatized by the event. They were all, they were here when it happened. Uh, my husband and my oldest son had to do CPR on me at home. Um, so I mean, they, you know, my oldest son was having his own PTSD and traumatized. Um, when I came home, you know, I was experiencing huge anxiety.\n",
            " I was having panic attacks, I was having heart palpitations. I couldn't sleep. But I, I just had to go through that on my own, you know, I couldn't say anything. And despite how much pain I was in or how low, you know, I was feeling, or how much I just wanted to sit and cry, I, I just had to slap the smile on my face and pretend like everything was fine. Um, I had to have a, one of the complications while I was in the ICU  is I had, I developed compartment syndrome in my left arm from a, a, a ruptured, uh, brachial artery from an art line. So I had to have an emergency fasciotomy. So my left arm was completely cut open, unusable. Um, I was in a lot of pain. My mom was really, really upset about my arm. And so I just had to say, you know, oh, it's fine.\n",
            " Oh, look how good it is today. You know, like, look, I can, I can lift it <laugh>. Um, but, you know, I couldn't feed myself. I couldn't look after myself. I couldn't do anything. But again, I just felt that need to put on the mask of the person who was happy and unaffected and feeling great when the reality is that I was feeling the opposite. And I think the biggest challenge of transitioning to home really was, um, for me, like that mental health aspect. Um, you know, I was seeing orthopedic surgeons for my knee. I was seeing plastic surgery for my fasciotomy, and I needed more surgery for that. I was going, having to go to the hand clinic for hand rehab. I was seeing hematology for my anticoagulation in my genetic workup. I was seeing vascular surgery. I had post thrombo-, I have post thrombolytic syndrome.\n",
            " I had to have more MRIs. I was seeing cardiology for echoes and monitoring of my pulmonary pressures. I was seeing wound care for looking after my open wound. I was having to have weekly visits with my family physician. I was seeing physiotherapy. Um, and I went very quickly from being a healthy person. I was incredibly active. I played tennis. I went hiking. I had a meaningful job. I looked after my family. I looked after my house. I did everything in the household to all of a sudden being able to do none of that, seeing all of those health professionals, I needed to have almost a a personal attendant to keep track of the appointments because it was just so overwhelming. But nobody ever once asked me, how are you doing? Like, nobody ever ever asked how I was feeling, or how I was doing, or how I was coping, or how I was managing. So on my own, I did seek out some mental health support and I ended up finding, um, a psychologist that I could go and see on my own. But that should have been part of everything. And that should have been from the get-go, um, when you're sent home from the hospital with all of this going on. Um, I think that that really needs to be addressed.\n",
            " If I was by myself, not, not with anybody.\n",
            " Yeah, no. Like, I still can't, I, you know, I, my, my mom is having her own, you know, they, they were only here for a couple weeks and then they had to go back to Nova Scotia, and then, um, my niece came out from Calgary to look after me. Um, but I mean, no. I mean, I, I still have to, um, just pretend, you know, that my, my, um, recovery's going really, really well and that every, you know, like, I, I had an ultrasound last Friday and, um, you know, I still have lots of clot, you know, still in my legs. And now I have to go and have another, um, uh, VQ scan in my lungs again. And, um, I had an appointment with the hematologist today, but, you know, I won't, I won't tell my mom that or talk to my mom about that or anything. Cause it's just, I just have to say, oh, I'm doing great. Everything's fine. Doing great, doing my physio. It's great.\n",
            " Thank you.\n",
            " Yeah, my sister's in Calgary. Um,\n",
            " Oh, thank you.\n",
            " Yeah, thank you. I can't believe that you found that perfect picture <laugh> to express all of that. It really was. Um, I don't think I've seen a lot of busted, um, walk, sign, uh, things on. So that was, was really, really, um, coincidental that you just found that absolutely perfect photo. And, um, yeah, I can relate, um, to what you say just about having those feelings, um, at times that, you know, you are a bit damaged. Um, I said, you know, after everything had happened that, you know, I couldn't walk, I couldn't use my arm, I couldn't do anything. I said, gosh, I'm all washed up at 48 <laugh>. Um, but, you know, time, time has a way of, uh, of healing things and of moving forward and, uh, I do hope that you're, you're feeling a bit better, um, about yourself and about that.\n",
            " Yeah, the, the photo of your stairs was really beautiful. And I think, uh, all of us view stairs differently now. <laugh>, you never think that those are gonna be the thing that, that trips you up. Um, you know, I was, I was lucky because I was planning for a knee surgery, um, for which I knew I was gonna be non-weightbearing for six to eight weeks post. So I had bought myself a cot on Amazon and I had my cot set up. I I live in a three-story house, um, cot set up on the main level and I had all that in place and good thing I did. Um, cause I, I wasn't allowed to do the stairs, uh, when I came home just because of my pulmonary function and my, my heart and whatnot. I was, I was told not to do any stairs. So yeah, it was, it was a good, uh, month or more before I was able to, to go back up and having three teenage boys. Um, I kind of regretted when I did actually make it up, but <laugh> <laugh>, um, yeah. But yeah, it's, uh, yeah, who would've thought stairs were the, uh, yeah, the big challenge. But yeah, thanks for, thanks for sharing\n",
            " Uh, but I thought I, I work in pediatric nephrology. Um, but I thought it was really funny when I was in the ICU, because the dietician came to see me and she goes, oh, I'm the dietician. The first thing I said was like, I'm a dietician <laugh>. And she said, I, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna put you on a high protein diet, you know, for your wound healing and blah, blah, blah. I'm like, oh, okay. And then I, I really wish, I mean, I, I didn't have my phone, uh, in the ICU with me, but I, I wish I had have taken a picture of, um, what arrived. But, um, I couldn't feed myself because I, I had my fasciotomy on this arm and I had tons of lines going into this arm. I couldn't bend it, so I couldn't feed myself. But the ICU, that was fine.\n",
            " Cause I had my, my private nurse that fed me, but she took the, the lid off the, the dinner that night. And it was literally like one teeny tiny chicken, like drum it, I think two tablespoons of white rice and like one tablespoon of like canned or frozen green beans. And I was looking at it like, okay, I don't know what calorie level you set me up for <laugh>, or, but this is definitely not, uh, high protein. But anyway, um, but one thing I, I did wanna mention, um, as I I said earlier, you know, I was, I was really bad at, um, asking for help or accepting help or I just found that part really difficult. And so what one of my, um, dietician colleagues did is, uh, she actually started a meal train. So it's actually an online program or, or, or platform that you, um, you create sort of a little, you know, um, blurb about what the person is experiencing and going through, and then you send it out.\n",
            " Um, so she sent it out to all the dieticians at the hospital as well as all my nephrology, um, coworkers and, um, had their slots days that you sign up to deliver a meal and, um, bring a meal by. And so that was really helpful. It's not something that I would've, I would've asked for. Um, it was something I desperately needed because not only it wasn't me, it was my family. Um, you know, cuz I'm the one who takes care of my family and I'm the one who cooks for everybody and my family. And so when I was no longer able to do that, you know, there was no one to do that. Um, so that, that was a really, really, um, really kind, uh, thing that she did. And, uh, I had no choice but to accept it because it was arriving on my doorstep. So <laugh>,\n",
            " I don't know if this is the exact right word, but I guess, um, just a solidarity.\n",
            "P1\t I also want you to say, um, thank you for sharing. And at first when I saw your photo, I wasn't really sure what you were gonna talk about cause it was so, um, abstract almost. Um, but yeah, as you went on, I, I definitely see the connection and, um, especially the part about, uh, you said how when you went back home, um, you were largely dependent on other people for their physical support and, you know, also just, um, to maintain your health and wellbeing and yeah, absolutely. It's like going back home and needing to rely on people. Definitely felt, um, it was, it was definitely new, especially when you're so used to having like nurses and, um, other staff assist you. But, um, yeah, being in the hands of family and friends definitely feels different. Um, but yeah, thank you for sharing your deal.\n",
            " Good eye there, good thought P5\n",
            " Yeah. Um, I wanna start with saying that everything you just said resonated so deeply with me, and it's, it's really touching and I have a lot of respect for you to have gone through that experience. Um, it's actually really surprising because I think my exact photo, uh, my photo, like, talks about the exact same thing, <laugh>. Um, but, uh, one thing I, I did wanna note is the near death experience thing. Um, I also explored the site, and I think, um, yeah, a after going through something like that, it really, it, it feels like your world view com completely changes. Um, at least for me, it did. Um, and I, I think like, well, I mean, I kind of went to cardiac arrest for, for a bit, and it, um, it, it just made me a lot more fearful, I think. Um, but there was also like a really strong need to be grateful because, you know, like you said, like at least you're not dead, right? Um, but yeah, it's a, it's definitely a really isolating experience. And, um, I'm honestly sorry, you have to go through that too. But, um, I, I do hope you can find the support you need now, and hopefully it's not as isolating. Um, but yeah, there, um, I hope, you know, it's not just you, but\n",
            " Oh, yeah. Um, so my photo is actually from, uh, taken from inside the sky train. Um, and, you know, when you look outside doors, you can kind of see, um, a view of the landscape. Um, but yeah, so when I think of home, I think of, um, the people that make home, home is more like a group or a people thing. Um, and so, yeah, I think of like, looking at this view, um, I thought of my transition and going back into these relationships and how they changed when I transitioned back home. Um, and so like standing on the sky train, you know, you're looking down at everyone. Um, and then I, I really felt like I was omniscient and I was, I was just looking at everyone's life's past in front of me. Um, so I, I definitely felt very much behind then. This was kind of at a time, and I was at an age where everyone was rapidly progressing in their lives.\n",
            " Um, you know, having just graduated high school, I, I wanted to do so much, but I felt held back, um, because of all these, like, medical issues, right? Um, so yeah, I felt really like inhibited by life's hand, I guess. And there was a really strong sense of unfairness that I couldn't help but dwell in. Um, and I tried really hard to not feel like I was at a disadvantage. Um, but there were definitely times where the negativity got to me when, you know, when I was transitioning home. Um, and yeah, so it was really hard to ever speak about why I was so distant and, um, behind in my studies or, you know, in pursuing my goals, um, as a teenager. Um, but yeah, it was just kind of tough because there was no one really in my immediate environment that I could truly empathize with or that could really support me.\n",
            " Um, and that was hard because at the same time, I really depended on their physical support, um, you know, being so weak and fragile. Um, and it, it was hard because everyone was so cautious when talking to me, like they wanted to pry and learn more, but they were also scared of offending me. And so it was like, I was so far out of reach and so disconnected, like standing on a sky train, right? You're so, you're so high above, you're so far from everyone. And I, I've thought about how transitioning back was really more about, um, transitioning back into my relationships. And, um, and, and that just left me feeling very much disconnected. Um, like being in a sky train, both strangers, um, you know, you're, you're, you're not alone, but still lonely. Um, and that's, that's something how I felt.\n",
            " Of course. Yeah.\n",
            " I, I can't say, you know, I'm, I'm like much less negative now, but, um, I think gradually I was able to become less cynical and um, it, it was definitely a path to stop, you know, dwelling in myself, pity. But, um, I, I will say when things, when I get, I get triggered easily by, uh, uh, um, my sensory environment and, um, in times like that, I, I tend to fall back in to spells of negativity.\n",
            " Oh, thank you for your response.\n",
            " Yeah, honestly, I feel like everyone else has already taken words outta my mouth. <laugh>, I really, I really do wanna say that, um, I, I, I am honestly so amazed that you, um, survived going back in and out. Um, I would, I would imagine each time to be, you know, a new different type of trauma. And I gotta give you props for making, you know, and still being honestly, seemingly very cheerful and optimistic about it all. Um, amid being, you know, having felt isolated and, um, being, being forced to be independent while also reliant on others for help. Um, it's, it's a conflicting feeling for sure. Um, but you are definitely strong and it shows\n",
            " Yeah. Your, um, your picture was, and the way you explained it was incredibly artistic, actually. It felt so poetic. Um, but like P4 said, I, I really, really respect the optimism and how you can find such beautiful moments, um, even when you're going through it. I, I think that is definitely a gift. Um, and then to notice, you know, the year after I'd make the connection <laugh> that it's like almost a sign, right? Um, that, that is <laugh>, honestly really lovely. And, um, it made me really happy hearing that actually,\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " Yeah, I wanted to say that was kind of like heartwarming, honestly. <laugh> <laugh>. Um, but yeah, absolutely adorable. Um, I also wonder if it, it feels pretty, would it be nice to know that, you know, um, rather than relying on, um, saying like hospital staff and family for help, you know, it, it was also nice to know that, um, someone relied on you and, um, it could have been cat. Yeah, I think that'd be really nice. Um, but yeah, the way, the way you worded that was\n",
            " Really uplifting <laugh>. Um, it was Really nice to hear. Thank you. Thank you for sharing.\n",
            " I have a lot of respect for everything you went through. That sounds like a treasured journey. And, um, I, I know if I were in your position, I don't, I don't think I would be able to, you know, still care for others and, um, you know, put on a constant facade of being all right. Um, so that is, you're definitely very strong for that. Um, and I, it must be extremely hard having, while you're going through your own struggles, your family is too, and though you are helping them, they're, they're never really getting back to you with yours. And it's, it's kind of unfair. I'm not sure how you cope with that, but, um, that is incredibly tough. And I, I hope you give yourself some kindness.\n",
            " Yeah, this is kind of an abstract photo. It's a little confusing, but, um, uh, the focus is on the pedestrian light. Um, it's kind of falling out its socket, um, uh, not socket, but it's, um, place <laugh>. Um, and I took this photo the other night, um, and I, and especially with like the rainy atmosphere, um, this was at like 12:00 AM I'm coming back from school. Um, it, it, it felt, it really evoked a lot of emotion in me. Um, and I think it represented a challenge of going back home, which was, um, just, just realizing how weak I was, especially surrounded by people who were so capable. Um, and, and like the sign I felt as if I was extremely, deeply damaged. Um, and, and so my voice was no longer as strong and that no one would take me seriously. And like, since the sign is kind of falling out, um, it's, it's signal to stop walking and it's not gonna be perceived as strong or that's how I interpreted it.\n",
            " Um, so I didn't feel as I would be listened too seriously and, um, rather I felt powerless and weak. Um, but, you know, like how it's, like how the pedestrian sign is still glowing. Um, it was, it, it was trying really hard to show that it was functional and still working. And, um, that's how I felt as well to there, there was like a strong inherent need to always prove myself to everyone, that I wasn't totally broken and I, I still had some worth. Um, and it, it was, it was a difficult transition cause you know, going home, it, it was really crazy. My family was really disappointed in me now that I was kind of like a damaged good and I wasn't of high value. And I think that was really hard because I, I, I wasn't like, you know, the kid that they wanted me to be.\n",
            " Um, and I think that was really a struggle. So I, I really wanted to prove myself that prove to myself and to them that I was still of some value. Um, but, you know, like having physical weaknesses, you know, like being in for a [inaudible] or having, like, losing so much hair or my teeth, it was, it was a clear sign that, you know, I couldn't cover up that, that I had failed in some ways, even though I didn't like, um, do anything to fail. And it was, it was really hard getting out of this mindset cause it's so incredibly negative. And that was definitely, um, a challenge. Um, but yeah, and a bit different. But, uh, the light also reminded me of, and especially with like, you know, the walk light, how it makes a noise. Um, it reminded me of like the noises, like the beeps and the, the lights that you would see in the hospital.\n",
            " And that, and that's like always a trigger for me. Hearing the repetitive beeping or the flashing lights. Like I, there was never pure darkness and, um, it always invokes the same feeling of helplessness that I felt in the hospital. Um, so that was also a challenge. But one facilitator that, uh, this reminded me of is actually the light. Uh, and being outside, being outside was such a huge benefit to my mental health, I think because just standing in direct sunlight, uh, really helped me feel, um, myself again and made me feel alive. Um, and it was just incredible feeling sun against my skin again. Uh, yeah.\n",
            " Um, yeah, I think it's, it's shifted a lot. I'm not as like, cynical anymore. Um, I, I'd like to like, not view myself as a failure, but um, rather try to recognize the strength that it took to get out of that head space. Um, but it's, it's difficult to remind yourself of that every time. Cause it feels, it doesn't feel genuine. And I think, um, it's hard not to compare to others who, especially my peers. Um, but I am working to get out of that, uh, mindset.\n",
            " Incredibly well said.\n",
            " That was really [inaudible]\n",
            " Yeah, uh, like you said, I, I really have to <laugh>. I'm really taking a lot from what everyone is saying. It's, it's really nice hearing, um, everyone's outlook on this, and especially what you said about the stairs and, um, you know, having the people around you. Uh, it's, it's really, it's really nice seeing, hearing your perspective of how you make accommodations to your needs and like once you come back home. Um, but it's, it's rather inspiring. And, um, thank you for that.\n",
            " I really like what you said, um, about, you know, having people bring stuff and how it makes you feel. Um, I really admire this aspect of you. You always have a way of wording things so artistically, um, and everything that comes outta your mouth is so eloquent, <laugh>. But yeah, I, I definitely think that, um, definitely needs to be some like, reform of the healthcare system, especially. I think these two aspects are the most important. Um, like nutrition and, um, mental health, especially like a follow up. Yes. Um, I would, I would imagine being incre- it would be incredibly hard for people to go back home and, you know, not, not know or not being able to fix themselves up a meal. Um, and yes, they should also do something with the quality of the food. I definitely agree. Um, it's, it, I feel like it even give people like PTSD of, you know, seeing those foods again. Like sometimes I see, um, the cranberry juice that they gave me or, um, you know, the styrofoam plates with, I don't know, I, I always had oatmeal, but it wasn't even oatmeal. It was like water and like four pieces of oats, <laugh>, and, um, the boiled eggs. I just couldn't eat that for like year or so. <laugh>. Yes. So yeah,\n",
            " I think for myself I can say that felt really cathartic.\n",
            "P2\t Um, oh, yes, thank you, P3. Uh, I, gorgeous picture and really thoughtful in regards to how it affected you and so many of the things, of course, that you shared exactly, exactly what I was feeling or going through at that time. Um, so it was just, I mean, I, I, I really related as well to how you saw yourself or at least saw the, the image and how you were gonna do it. I, it's so funny because when I first looked at it, or when you first were explaining that, I thought, oh, she's gonna run up to that log on its side and have to high jump over it or, and, and then to her future. And so <laugh>, and then when you said, of course, cross it, I thought, oh my God, that looks like a much more sensible way. <laugh>\n",
            " Anyway, though, thank you very much. It was really,\n",
            " Um, sorry. Oh, uh, I, I really liked your picture as well, and, and what you had to say. Um, I also can relate to, I've not checked out that I, that's the first time I've heard of the near I of the near death. Um, you, you're gonna have to repeat it later on, but at any rate, um, it is something I, I, the first time that I was in ICU, um, I ended up having to have heart surgery and part of the whole thing not to be too whatever, is they, they take your heart out for several hours and do their, their thing that they're doing. And so I don't know if that, if that belongs in that category, but, um, it, it, it, I don't think I've been the same since, not necessarily badly, but, but I, I don't also have, it's hard to have people to relate to that experience that, that, um, you know, I mean, it, I've worked at palliative care at the hospital\n",
            " I enjoyed it very much. Um, and I really felt I belong, you know, I had felt I had a good relationship with death. Well, this really changed that. All of a sudden I was afraid of the idea, and it was always there. Um, and yeah, and it, it is hard. At least I believe it's hard for someone who hasn't been in this situation to. So I sure appreciated it. And in regards to that, looking in, standing outside, looking in, uh, that's so often I felt that I can relate to that very much so. Thank you very much. And, and what you had to say really resonated as well. Thanks. Thanks.\n",
            " Um, um, that was kind of beautifully explained, I think, and I, I understand the, that feeling of negativity because, well, yeah. I mean, I revisit that <laugh> more fairly frequently. I, uh, when I was young, my dad had a heart attack, uh, at a very young age. So for whatever reason, that was, you know, it's just sort of been in my, in my head like, uh, oh, you know, I mean, um, I don't know how long I'm gonna be here, sort of thing. And so, uh, as far as being cynical or how, I mean, sometimes I think it's okay to sit in cynicism for a while just to, I don't know. I don't know. Sometimes it can be relaxing, but it's not a good place to stay <laugh>. And by relaxing I just mean, you know, um, those, those thoughts and those that kind of like, oh, what next, you know, sort of thing as I'm familiar with. So anyway, thank you for, thank you for sharing, and it was a great picture.\n",
            " Yeah. Um, I accidentally sent in my, my written stuff too, but at any rate, um, you know, I hope it's not too cliche, but I was just washing dishes and I just kind of, um, noticed the shadow, the, this angel thing in the shadow. And, um, I just thought, geez, that, I mean, that's how I felt was not like an angel. But, um, hiding out in, once I got home, I didn't want to feel, I didn't, I felt really vulnerable. I didn't want to feel vulnerable, um, in front of people, which I've been through before, and it's so stupid. But yet anyway, so it just seemed quite bright out. It wasn't a nice day or anything. Um, but, uh, I, I just like that it's sort of, it, it felt like, kind of like, uh, what my experiences have sort of done to me. Not that I'm isolated. I have a lot of people in my life for sure, but that's that inner time when you don't feel people can relate to what you might have to say, or you don't wanna not burden them. But I don't know, I, I always want to be invisible when I'm really vulnerable. Um, and that's probably not a great trait. But anyway, um, so yeah, I guess it was, that's, that's, that's sort of that.\n",
            " Yeah, definitely. Definitely. That's changed over time. Um, yes, <laugh>,\n",
            " If I, if I put my life into thirds, I've had, uh, at each third I've kind of had a, a fairly dramatic, each time, different, but long, you know, being in the hospital for a month, once it was two months, um, at any rate, lung issues, and then heart issues, and now COPD issues. So the first time I was, I was in, I was gone, you couldn't find me, I, uh, called up my dad and said, dad, I just can't, I thought I could do this, but I, uh, whatever. So I flew home for this healing time and, um, and then, you know, so that's hiding out. And the second time, I, I, I, I had no choice. I didn't, I just had no choice. And so I really appreciated it so much, you know, people helping, um, that, that time. Uh, but I'd say, yeah, I've gotten better, but, um, hopefully there won't be lots of times that that has to happen. Um, but that's definitely, that's me right there not being an angel, clearly.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " Thank you.\n",
            " Thank you.\n",
            " Yeah, that's,\n",
            " That's, uh, that's a great metaphor for sure, for that. Thanks, P3.\n",
            " Oh, thanks, P4\n",
            " Oh, thanks P1.\n",
            " Yeah. For anyone? I'm good to just go along.P3 (00:44:27): Me too.\n",
            " Actually you know, it's also one of those times where what you all said, um, very much what, what I, I really agree with it. I love the picture and I actually, I, I mean, I know that I was having to kind of darken it with my imagination a bit, or, I mean, make it more clear. But I can see that going right up there. It just sort of in that image with the, anyway, beautiful and really cool. I've never experienced that. Um, but it's, it, I love that. I just love, you know, finding those moments and cuz they're there and, and it's, it's great that you, that you can do that and that you do that and you're very eloquent and as well, so I mean.\n",
            " Yes. And sorry about my voice, you guys. I, sometimes it's, anyway, it's getting a little cracky.\n",
            " Got it. I was just trying to say I couldn't hear Facilitator AD\n",
            " Sure. I love Abe, so I mean, thank you. Gorgeous. Um, and I, you know, as soon as you said that, of course, uh, it just resonated, uh, be, I mean, what would I have done if I didn't have my pets? And I always have had, I've been lucky enough that, um, I had a cat for 18 years and then I got another cat for 18 years. Wow. And yeah, so lucky. And there was, there were a dog or two in there, but at any rate, oh, if I didn't have some, we now have a young cat cuz all of our, our other ones have passed away in this past Covid time. Um, but she's just awesome. And like all the animals, like you get home and, uh, that's it. It's just, you know, love there. Nobody's questioning anything, just wanna be in your company. And so that's, uh, that's great. That really resonated with me. Thanks.\n",
            " Yeah, P4. That, that was, um, that was spot on as far as, I mean, I think I'm more selfish than I used to be. And I don't, I mean, the good selfish mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but it's like, that's, I've been a caregiver. That's what, that was my role in the family. That was my role. I remember I, um, anyway, um, not important. Um, but I mean, by family, I mean brothers and sisters and whatnot. And, uh, it just always has been. Those were the, the, um, that, that's, that's, that was a career I went into, and in all manner of different things, but always that, so to, I didn't consider it to be something that would, that I didn't have  you know, the ability to access. So when you say that, I hear it so profoundly, um, not just cuz it's me, but I just felt like what you said was, ugh. Mental hug. <laugh>. Thank you. <laugh>. Oh, teenagers though. Oh, anyways. Thank you. Thank you P4.\n",
            " I'm sorry. Poetic. I mean, like everything that you said, that picture just really, um, reflected everything you were saying, but it looked, it, it was very, very interesting. But you held onto that, um, brightness, you know, like as you said, oh, it's falling out and it's, it's, it's damaged, but there's this whole bright aspect because it's still functioning and being positive and finding that, that, um, hopeful state of mind. I mean, it's tough sometimes, but sometimes you get there and then what, what is it? Um, two steps forward and one step back or whatever. Um, cuz it still keeps coming back if, you know, that's how I feel. I try not to get too, I just always think I'm malleable. I can ban, I can, you know, meanwhile, I'm the same person. I saw Jaws when I was a kid. The movie Jaws I was having, I still have trouble with fresh water, bodies of water, <laugh>. So, I mean, like, it's, it's, it's, it's both. But thank you very much.\n",
            " <laugh>. Okay. Um, um, on the topic of, you know, things that facilitated, things that seemed hard, um, so <laugh>, this is, I'm embarrassed to say these are my front steps and, um, these stairs not very long ago, I mean months ago, were absolutely fine. Um, but, uh, some of this bad weather over the last while and I hadn't been out, um, really taking care of the things and stuff. So anyways, these face facial boards, they also, raccoons got at them. So anyway, the point is <laugh>, they're still completely safe because the weightbearing part of it is all, um, totally sound and fine, but looking at it face forward, it's like, I mean, if all those broken boards were gone, um, you would be completely safe as you walked up. However, that makes, cause nobody's gonna really want to come up to your house. Um, so I kind of felt, when I saw this, I just thought, oh, I don't think I can do this.\n",
            " I don't think I can fix this right now. Or, or if, if at all. Cuz certain things absolutely just win me. And this is the type of stuff that, I mean, I built those stairs years and years ago, but oh my god, I just couldn't even imagine fixing them. So it's a recent problem and I hope in the future to be able to show you all a picture the, of these beautiful steps that are fixed. Anyhow, um, I live in a hundred year old house, lots of, um, uh, little skinny stairwells. Um, and so to come up into my house, it's, I mean I, all of a sudden for the first time it's like, oh wow, I, I, uh, I don't know if I can go up to bed, like up to the bedroom, sort of an attic room, but it's a huge, huge space.\n",
            " Um, but I thought I'm gonna have to go in a bedroom on the main floor I guess or something. And also all of those helpful things like, um, all of a sudden, you know, friends brought over things like, oh, here's this thing you can put in your tub that you can sit on and still hold the shower. Cuz <laugh>, I couldn't do that either. Oh my god. So this is just supposed to represent that, um, uh, there are all these things that can be barriers and will be, or, um, ho- hopefully temporarily, some maybe not. But at any rate, um, this kind of has a, a good enough foundation that I can still get in and out. But, oh, I forgot where I, sorry, I forgot where my train of thought was going. Oh, right. Just these things, like the skinny stairs, having to sit on a stool in the, in the shower for, I don't know, I, I think I had to do that for about a month after I was home, but it, it just seems a lot scarier for the longest time. And it's not that it's not now, you know, but, uh, anyway, come inside the house, that's all <laugh>. That's it.\n",
            " Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It's, um, I, I, I was lucky, um, even though before I went into the hospital, cuz it was a buildup. I was ridiculous. Um, um, my husband was, um, uh, back east visiting his mom for a month. So I started to, I ended up catching pneumonia and it was getting worse. So much so that, well, I would, I would crawl up to my bedroom, no one could see me. So it was okay, but still, I, you know, I didn't get attention and I didn't go for attention, medical attention for way too long. That was so dumb of me. I'm so much smarter that, but anyway, um, when I finally went, my husband was back and, uh, uh, my brother lives with us too, so I mean, uh, whatever. But, um, I just, I went in to take a shower and I couldn't, I could just stop being able to breathe.\n",
            " So I, you know, I yelled for my husband and I, um, uh, anyway, that's the book for, uh, uh, and I kind of made this squeaking noise, like, ah, you know, so that was my second ride in an ambulance. And, uh, it was fun. I mean, they were very nice. I have always had, I, I just, I feel pretty grateful for, um, a lot of the care. You know, I feel like, um, I've been very lucky, you know, in terms of care and, and I love nurses my whole life. Um, you know, my mom was a nurse and her two sisters, my favorite aunts were nurses, cousins, um, my dad's sister, they read the that or teachers and, um, so I mean, I hospital really helps that way for me. I've never, it's just sort of, it, I don't know. Now I'm babbling, that's all. Sorry, <laugh>.\n",
            " For sure. Thanks.\n",
            " Yeah, thank you P3.\n",
            " <laugh>. Thanks P4.\n",
            " No, thank you. Thanks P1.\n",
            " <laugh>.\n",
            " Yeah, <laugh>.\n",
            " <affirmative>,\n",
            " Um, yes, yes. Um, I'm not a nutritionist, um, but hubby did run the Canadian School of Natural Nutrition for a while, so he brings that expertise in actually for, so we've been together 30 years and, um, we've always had a really good diet. It's always like, not that I have anything against restaurants, I love restaurants, but I probably eat at home 95% of the time and, um, uh, you know, pretty good food, fresh vegetables, et cetera. But, and I hope no one can hear me downstairs. Um, my brother came to live with us, uh, some years ago and, um, <affirmative>, anyway, my brother now cooks all the meals and we grew up in a very, um, you know, uh, we, we had to take care of ourselves in a sense, like as, as kids in, in the family I grew up in. So everything was like, you get home for lunch and it's a can of beef stew by God.\n",
            " It was the worst thing ever or a can of something. And so he still eats like this and <laugh> because it was kinda like, look bro, you have to, you have to do something here. That was what it was. And I also recognize that he feels he's, he's being very helpful to me because I have, I have problems with this now, and it's literally just standing as long as you need to stand to, to cook things, I'll still figure out something. But, uh, and I do weekends, but at any rate, so I worry about, I would like to have a dietician come in here and whack him around a bit and say, but he's very, he's, he's been a very big help. So I don't mean, I'm just speaking anyways. I'm with you. Nutrition <laugh>, proper nutrition. Yeah.\n",
            " Yeah. <laugh> already. Excellent thought.\n",
            " Me too. Excellent.\n",
            " No, no. I now <laugh> it was the perfect word for that. I, I'm just gonna think of something that seems like that <laugh> <laugh>. Um, enlightenment.\n",
            " Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.\n",
            "P5\t <laugh>.\n",
            " Thank you so much, P3. It's a beautiful picture. Um, and you know, I know you very well. I know your story, but it's always nice to, to hear it back. Um, and, uh, when I saw the picture, first of all, I love it. It's, it's beautiful. I saw the log as well being the obstacle, and you explained it very well, but then it also struck that it's like a rebirth, right? Like when, uh, tree falls, it actually blends with the ground, and then some mushrooms come out of it and some mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah, <laugh>.\n",
            " <laugh>. And then I also thought of the road, and actually my picture you'll see is also about the road. So I think we all see that there's a, a transition in a journey that starts, uh, after we leave the ICU.\n",
            " \n",
            " I agree with everyone. I think, uh, this is a great message and such a visual way to express what you went through. Um, I could relate to the near death experience. I think I've lived it, not in the context I think of being in the ICU, but just in, in very stressful times in my life, actually, my brother as well was in the ICU. So that was a, a very stressful time. Um, and like you said, to talk about it, to maybe find people that you can have this exchange is very, very beneficial. Um, and maybe when that happened, it was bringing you to a new frequency, a new, like, you're expanding, right? You're evolving as a person, and then the, the analogy of the window is like, you're just somewhere else in a way, and it's trying to reconnect with, with people. Um, so I'm sure it was very difficult for you to just go through physically what you went through, but also in the mental way, uh, what, what you've gone through and the experience itself. So thank you for sharing this picture. Thanks.\n",
            " Thank you so much, P1. This was a great picture, and it, it really touched me, uh, for many reasons. I spoke a bit about my brother, that he was in icu and it happened when he was 16 years old. Um, I'm not sure when it happened to you, but it was in that critical time where it was about his friends. And so I can completely relate. I can understand what you went through. Um, at the same time, like anything, I think life sometimes throws, you know, curve balls at us to rise above that and actually find happiness. Um, and this could be so easy to say, but same time for a child or a person of that age, you had a lifetime that you lived in a small period. So it gives you that wisdom and way to evolve that, you know, there's no price for that. So, in a way, maybe this is the gratitude that, you know, as you go through this, uh, through your life, maybe the gratitude will come more and more in that, in that way. Um, but I can relate to you so much. Yeah, that was really kind.\n",
            " <laugh>,\n",
            " Thank you so much, P2. I love, uh, your image and your analogy and, and what you, how you're processing it. Um, and maybe the common theme and, and the stories that we just heard is it's all a question of not feeling like you're relating to anyone, uh, through your illness and what you've gone through. Um, and to maybe have that inner world that we may have found at the ICU  I know for me, this is what actually brought me to get out of it in a, in a positive way, but I think it's introspection and to that we all come stronger with time. Um, and if you've lived it three times, you're a warrior. <laugh>.\n",
            " Thank you for sharing.\n",
            " Okay. So, um, initially I was planning on sharing with you guys a picture of our Christmas tree, um, and all the ornaments in it because it reminded me of, you know, the homecoming, um, and the gratitude, you know, being around the people that I love and just being, you know, back home. Um, also the ornaments talking about my life, like really, we put everything from our, the birth of my first baby to a mountain that we just visited. Like, it's just a story of our life. So I figured the tree was just representing my experience, uh, through, through the ICU. And then yesterday, um, it was a hectic day and I was just, uh, with my, my youngest daughter, she was napping in the car, and I was waiting for my eldest. And then <inaudible>, I decided to just go for a nice drive around the lake where, where we live.\n",
            " And I had just a moment of just, again, feeling grateful because through my experience, it unleashed a lot of beautiful things in my life because I had to rediscover who I was, and it gave me a lot of strength and to move even to the Laurentian’s, which is where we live now, in the mountains. Um, so as I was driving, um, the sunset just, you know, appeared on this picture, but it's hard for you maybe to see, but it, it was actually, it's called a  crepuscular sunset. So where you see the sun, there's, it was actually a beam going all the way up to the sky. Um, it's, it was hard. It's hard to sound the picture, but it, it really happened. And I never seen that in my life. Um, it was a moment of like, oh my God, this, I'm meant to be this at this particular time, and all the experiences of my life, including the ICU, just, you know, it's part of my, my journey.\n",
            " Um, also this picture represents, you know, the obstacle, the fact that there's trees there, going to maybe the, the journey of being back home and being in a safe place. There was still hurdles to go through, which was, you know, uh, like everyone is saying, just being back in the pace of life. I had my youngest baby that was just 13 months that I had to take care of. I had no energy. So there was still some obstacles in front of me, but there was that beam right there, and I was just keeping an eye on that, uh, mentally. Anyways, so when I took the picture, five minutes later, I'll show you guys. I was driving, I don't know if you can see, but two deers appeared on the road.\n",
            " Yes, it's a video. Yes, I'll send it to a new, it just confirmed that this moment in time had to happen, and, you know, we have to accept things that ha that are negative and just keep on going, basically.\n",
            " Yes, um, it actually brings me to the next picture. So there was a lot of support, right, uh, from my family, uh, nutrition wise, uh, making sure that there was meals for me, um, and just telling them like, listen, I really can't walk. I can't do anything like being very vocal about my capacities, but at the same time, setting small steps every day, um, to walk further and, and faster and kind of like self-motivate. But through that process, I felt very alone, very, very alone. And you wanna show that you're strong and that you have it, everything, you know, all together. But in reality, I was far from it. And three months later, that's when my, you know, post, uh, ICU episode happened. And I think this is, was probably the compound of showing how strong I was and how I was able to do everything.\n",
            " Thank you. Thank you, P4.\n",
            " <laugh>. Thank you P1. If I can add, it's all over us. I think it's just tuning in into those, those gifts that we have every day.\n",
            " Yep.\n",
            " We, I'm good. \n",
            " <laugh>. If this adorable is like a little fluff ball. I wish I could just sleep on him. Was he a pillow?\n",
            " Yeah. Aw. Oh. But it reminds us of like the simple things, right? That you're maybe more in tune after the ICU on the needs that you have and the simple need of having comfort and maybe even affection from your pets, and then maybe the people around you. I know for me, I was more open to touching, uh, people around me, uh, after I think it kind of cut a barrier that I maybe had before. Um, so very lucky that you have a little football. I wish I could have one. We have a parrot as you know. So Yeah, <laugh> another kind of cuteness <laugh>.\n",
            " One day. Oh yeah, <laugh> so cute. He actually will fluff up. That's what, if he sees the cat is gonna, is gonna go like this. So, and you actually have the same color. Too gray.\n",
            " Thank you so much, P4, for sharing. You should be very, very proud of yourself for the degree of introspection that you have with how you've gone through the whole experience. What are your challenges? Most people are not even there. They're, they're maybe losing themselves, especially with all the appointments. And, and so at the same time that facade is there, you're still living and being aligned with how you feel now. There's a lot of energy that you're actually putting into that mask. And maybe with time to shift it to go more into this self care and, and opening up, uh, we'll get you to heal even more. Thank you for sharing.\n",
            " Thank you so much, P1. Um, I love what you just said in the picture. Uh, it just reminded me how vulnerable we were through the ICU. Um, and specifically when, you know, being that you're very young, you must have felt even more bare. Like as we age, we define ourselves more, we know who we are. But imagine going through that at that age and already not having that of an identity maybe, and then going through such a, a vulnerable time, um, could be difficult. But the same time it's a stepping stone to break free, break free of maybe what your family's expecting from you and then create something extraordinary, uh, in your own terms. You mentioned also mindset, and it reminds me of when I was in the ICU, how there was a shift that happened. Um, I was going through a lot of stress right before my, my septic shock. And, um, when I, I found gratitude, I shifted everything. And then after my whole life kind of like shit like Kaleidoscope, everything turned in a different direction. Uh, so maybe to going back to that and going, okay, I'll start with my mindset and just kind of let things flow in that same direction.\n",
            " You're very mature and thank you for sharing.\n",
            " Thank you P2. Um, I feel that it shows that you're very resilient. I mean, what, you've gone through the three major events of your life and maybe the stairs representing the hurdles that you went through and that it, you're still solid, you're still there and, and the steps also of your recovery, uh, back home. Uh, so thank you for sharing\n",
            " On my picture as if you, um, facets to it. Um, it's a closeup of my Tupperwares <laugh>. I dunno if, I mean, I'm really into Tupperwares. I'm a dietician. So for me it's like they gotta be filled with food. Um, and obviously when I came back, that was the last thing. I was not organized. And, and, um, that was my barriers was, is to really have, you know, nourishing foods available to me. Now I expressed it and I had all the support in the world, but that made me reflect how for a lot of people, this is not possible. They don't have the means, they don't have the support. Um, and if anything, whenever we come out of the ICU  it's all about nourishment in all aspects, mentally, physically. I mean, for sepsis it's very important to have, you know, high protein and high calorie foods. But unfortunately my appetite was at zero. Like, it was so difficult to even put anything in. Um, so that inspired me to first of all cope with that and, and really work through my, uh, my problem of appetite, but also to eventually be becoming a patient partner and working on, you know, nutrition and, and sepsis and creating, uh, maybe some tools on the long term to help, uh, survivors, uh, in terms of their diets. So this has a few facets. Um, and definitely nutrition is a huge role whenever we come outta the ICU. Yeah.\n",
            " Yes. So I was lucky to have a few freezers filled just randomly <laugh> when I came back. So there was a few meals there, but I was still lucky. Like my family, my aunts, my uncles, uh, my friends, they all came food. And uh, I had my two freezers filled to the brink for the good month and a half after. So good. Yes. Excellent. But like I was saying, that really made me realize how it's not the situation that most people come home to mm-hmm. <affirmative> and that may, you know, explain why the recovery is so hard. Right. Nutrition is the base of everything.\n",
            " <laugh>?\n",
            " Excuse me for just one moment. Sorry. Yeah, I'm just, go on.\n",
            " Yeah, this see, this is all part of maybe the resources that should be automatically given to any ICU survivor. Um, and to have something in place, even like when you do a follow up in the community, like what's your support in terms of nutrition and so on. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it reminds me of when also when I was in the ICU how the food was not adequate at all. And my husband was always coming with, uh, sushi or even he wanted, wanted to do a candlelight dinner. I'm like, no, you don't do that in the ICU, like\n",
            " But I just to say, you know, hospital food is, is what it is. And, and people have to think outside the box and research and, you know, add basically to, to their diet. So nice that your dietician.\n",
            " You were mentioning the mental health, um, intertwined with eating, but we're realizing more and more that mental health is linked to our gut health. Um, so maybe eventually a, again, ICUs could really focus on nourishing the gut so that we come out also better and more resilient and have less of the trauma afterwards. So lots of work to be done in that field.\n",
