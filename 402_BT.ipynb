So I went out with an idea in mind of a photo that I wanted to take. It was of a road, actually, just the road. Cause that's why I felt like it was, the journey behind me was a road and the journey, another long road. And then as I was coming, this was taken at the park. And as I was coming outta the park off to my right, I saw this and I just like almost slammed on the brakes. Unfortunately, nobody was behind me. I had to get off the side of the road. It just spoke to me. So I just got very emotional because the whole time I've been thinking about what did I want this photo to be, et cetera, et cetera.

So to transfer that log could be dangerous, could be scary. And how I felt not leaving the safety net of the hospital, given the fact that the night before I had quite an event where I almost passed out in the bathroom and they still sent me home the next morning. I was very apprehensive about that transition home and the fear of landing. And, and that's one of the post long haul symptoms I've had, is that living with that fear of getting, for my case, it was again, getting sick again and ending up back in hospital and experience that all over again. So that's what that kinda represents to me. Um, yeah, like it just spoke out to me and I just had to take the  photo. It was such a pleasure to do this. Like, it was like, wow, I gave lots of time to think. Do you want me to go through the questions?\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': ' Um,  whatever, whatever you feel like you wanna do, go, go for it if you wanna'}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '00:02:32)', 'speech': ''}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': \" Yep.

And I was going home with still existing problems. I was not a hundred percent recovered. I was facing the likelihood of another major surgery, which I did have, but, put off for at least another year. Cause I was just too terrified to go back and have more surgery. Um, but, and also just that fear of, um, I knew that there was some risk factors associated with being back at home and fear of would I ever get back to myself again? Because I was like, I mean, I was using a walker. I could barely, I needed help to shower. I needed help to, like, I was far from the person I was before I got ill.

So first off, P3, I amazing photo and I so can relate to what you're talking about and had many of the same feelings and concerns that you did. And, you know, when you were describing it and you were describing your photo and how it spoke to you, it, it did really, you know, evoke a lot of emotion, uh, in me because, um, yeah, it, it's very, very, very close to the heart. So, um, thank you for sharing and that is a, a really, really good photo. Thank you.\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': \" Thank you, P4.

And at first when I saw your photo, I wasn't really sure what you were gonna talk about cause it was so, um, abstract almost. Um, but yeah, as you went on, I, I definitely see the connection and, um, especially the part about, uh, you said how when you went back home, um, you were largely dependent on other people for their physical support and, you know, also just, um, to maintain your health and wellbeing and yeah, absolutely. It's like going back home and needing to rely on people. Definitely felt, um, it was, it was definitely new, especially when you're so used to having like nurses and, um, other staff assist you. But, um, yeah, being in the hands of family and friends definitely feels different.

Um, so it was just, I mean, I, I, I really related as well to how you saw yourself or at least saw the, the image and how you were gonna do it. I, it's so funny because when I first looked at it, or when you first were explaining that, I thought, oh, she's gonna run up to that log on its side and have to high jump over it or, and, and then to her future. And so <laugh>, and then when you said, of course, cross it, I thought, oh my God, that looks like a much more sensible way. <laugh>\"}, {'participant': 'P5', 'time': '00:08:14)', 'speech': ' <laugh>.'}, {'participant': 'P2', 'time': '00:08:15)', 'speech': ' Anyway, though, thank you very much.

Um, and you know, I know you very well. I know your story, but it's always nice to, to hear it back. Um, and, uh, when I saw the picture, first of all, I love it. It's, it's beautiful. I saw the log as well being the obstacle, and you explained it very well, but then it also struck that it's like a rebirth, right? Like when, uh, tree falls, it actually blends with the ground, and then some mushrooms come out of it and some mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah, <laugh>.\"}, {'participant': 'P1', 'time': '00:08:52)', 'speech': ' Good eye there, good thought P5'}, {'participant': 'P5', 'time': '00:08:54)', 'speech': \" <laugh>.

So I think we all see that there's a, a transition in a journey that starts, uh, after we leave the ICU.\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': \" Thank you so much. That's really quick, but it's also really great to see, um, some of the, the conversation that happens. So, P4, you are next.

What was it like to transition from hospital to home? Go ahead.'}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '00:09:52)', 'speech': \" So, I think I kind of approached it a little differently. I kind of lumped the question altogether in one. So I think really both of my photos kind of speak probably to both aspects, but this more to the first question. And I also didn't do the, um, reflection questions individually. I kind of read them and thought about them and then kind of lumped it in. And I, I did write something. I just, I'm less nervous than I do better <laugh> if I have something written out. So I'll just go through and, and kind of wrote, uh, what I wrote about this. So this was called on the outside looking in. And what I wanted to capture in this image is that that's really how I felt when I returned home from the hospital. Um, my life had been so profoundly changed. I didn't really know, you know, who I was, how I fit in, how I was gonna move forward and everything around me.\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '00:10:44)', 'speech': \" You know, my family, like, they all just kept going. And I really did feel like, you know, I was on the outside looking in on all the activity and everything that was going on. Um, everyone was happy and they were very alive and doing everything they normally do. Um, my kids were going to all their activities and my husband's going to work, and, you know, my parents were luckily here. Um, but I didn't feel that way and I didn't feel that they understood, you know, what I had been through and how it had affected me. And I think one of the things that affected me most deeply during my experience was I actually did have a near death experience. And, you know, I don't know if anybody else had that and if they might be willing to share after I, I would be curious to know.\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '00:11:34)', 'speech': \" But, uh, that was very, very, uh, it was a very life altering and profound experience, but I had absolutely nobody that I could talk to about that. I didn't feel that I could share it with anybody. I was worried people wouldn't understand. They wouldn't believe me. I was worried. They might think I was, you know, a little bit crazy. Um, I felt really alone, really isolated. So I did a lot of research, uh, you know, on the internet. I got lots of books from the library. I probably read five or six books, uh, about near death experiences. And through that I found the Near Death Experience Research Foundation. It's the NDEFR. And their website was really valuable to me. You actually can post, uh, your experience and they do, uh, publish it online. And so it just allowed validation for me of my experience and made me feel like I wasn't alone in that.\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '00:12:33)', 'speech': \" And, um, that was really the therapeutic to be able to share. And I also felt, I guess, a little bit guilty because part of, there was a part of me that, you know, when I was going through that didn't want to come back and to have felt that way. And then to be back, you know, I felt guilty, you know, every, all anyone said to me, I, I couldn't complain about anything. I couldn't complain about how I was feeling because all I would get is, well, you're alive. You, you're not dead. You're alive. You should be happy that you're alive. And I, I just, um, I felt guilty, I guess, for not feeling happy that I'd survived, because now I was living with all the pain and the life altering ramifications of what had happened. And I really felt like I was standing on the outside looking in, and that nobody really could understand or help me.\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': ' Thank you, P4. Um, has that changed for you, like outside of Photovoice, but have you, has that changed for you? Like by connecting with this foundation you spoke about?

I mean, I have, I have shared it with, uh, a few friends, but again, I mean, unless you've really experienced that and you've been through that, I mean, I, I don't think people really do understand or can understand. Um, you know, I haven't shared it with, you know, my parents or, or anybody. I briefly kind of alluded to it with my husband, but I don't know. He's, he's very factual and, and very matter of fact. And, uh, he's, he's a surgeon physician himself. And so, you know, he just, he sees, you know, he just says, well, I just see the worst of the worst and nothing phases me. And, you know, he just doesn't really have a lot of, I guess, empathy or sympathy or understanding along those lines.

Um, I wanna start with saying that everything you just said resonated so deeply with me, and it's, it's really touching and I have a lot of respect for you to have gone through that experience. Um, it's actually really surprising because I think my exact photo, uh, my photo, like, talks about the exact same thing, <laugh>. Um, but, uh, one thing I, I did wanna note is the near death experience thing. Um, I also explored the site, and I think, um, yeah, a after going through something like that, it really, it, it feels like your world view com completely changes. Um, at least for me, it did. Um, and I, I think like, well, I mean, I kind of went to cardiac arrest for, for a bit, and it, um, it, it just made me a lot more fearful, I think. Um, but there was also like a really strong need to be grateful because, you know, like you said, like at least you're not dead, right? Um, but yeah, it's a, it's definitely a really isolating experience. And, um, I'm honestly sorry, you have to go through that too. But, um, I, I do hope you can find the support you need now, and hopefully it's not as isolating. Um, but yeah, there, um, I hope, you know, it's not just you, but\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '00:16:24)', 'speech': ' Thank you.'}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': ' Thank you, P2.'}, {'participant': 'P2', 'time': '00:16:29)', 'speech': \" Um, sorry. Oh, uh, I, I really liked your picture as well, and, and what you had to say. Um, I also can relate to, I've not checked out that I, that's the first time I've heard of the near I of the near death. Um, you, you're gonna have to repeat it later on, but at any rate, um, it is something I, I, the first time that I was in ICU, um, I ended up having to have heart surgery and part of the whole thing not to be too whatever, is they, they take your heart out for several hours and do their, their thing that they're doing. And so I don't know if that, if that belongs in that category, but, um, it, it, it, I don't think I've been the same since, not necessarily badly, but, but I, I don't also have, it's hard to have people to relate to that experience that, that, um, you know, I mean, it, I've worked at palliative care at the hospital\"}, {'participant': 'P2', 'time': '00:17:33)', 'speech': \" I enjoyed it very much. Um, and I really felt I belong, you know, I had felt I had a good relationship with death. Well, this really changed that. All of a sudden I was afraid of the idea, and it was always there. Um, and yeah, and it, it is hard. At least I believe it's hard for someone who hasn't been in this situation to. So I sure appreciated it. And in regards to that, looking in, standing outside, looking in, uh, that's so often I felt that I can relate to that very much so. Thank you very much.

I think, uh, this is a great message and such a visual way to express what you went through. Um, I could relate to the near death experience. I think I've lived it, not in the context I think of being in the ICU, but just in, in very stressful times in my life, actually, my brother as well was in the ICU. So that was a, a very stressful time. Um, and like you said, to talk about it, to maybe find people that you can have this exchange is very, very beneficial. Um, and maybe when that happened, it was bringing you to a new frequency, a new, like, you're expanding, right? You're evolving as a person, and then the, the analogy of the window is like, you're just somewhere else in a way, and it's trying to reconnect with, with people.

I take some comfort in hearing what you just have to say because you had an ND which meant you, you got a glimpse into what is beyond what we experience here. And the fact that you said you didn't wanna come back must mean that it's an amazing, beautiful place. So thank you for sharing that. I look for, I'd like to hear your story. I feel sad that you can't share that with your family, um, and feel that you could be heard and understood. Um, so, um, my ears are open.

Um, and so, yeah, I think of like, looking at this view, um, I thought of my transition and going back into these relationships and how they changed when I transitioned back home. Um, and so like standing on the sky train, you know, you're looking down at everyone. Um, and then I, I really felt like I was omniscient and I was, I was just looking at everyone's life's past in front of me. Um, so I, I definitely felt very much behind then.

Um, and I tried really hard to not feel like I was at a disadvantage. Um, but there were definitely times where the negativity got to me when, you know, when I was transitioning home. Um, and yeah, so it was really hard to ever speak about why I was so distant and, um, behind in my studies or, you know, in pursuing my goals, um, as a teenager.

And so it was like, I was so far out of reach and so disconnected, like standing on a sky train, right? You're so, you're so high above, you're so far from everyone. And I, I've thought about how transitioning back was really more about, um, transitioning back into my relationships. And, um, and, and that just left me feeling very much disconnected.

And so I can completely relate. I can understand what you went through. Um, at the same time, like anything, I think life sometimes throws, you know, curve balls at us to rise above that and actually find happiness. Um, and this could be so easy to say, but same time for a child or a person of that age, you had a lifetime that you lived in a small period. So it gives you that wisdom and way to evolve that, you know, there's no price for that.

You've experienced something that most people don't go through. I know, I know there's always lots of young children critically on that, but that will give you an opportunity and lens at life that is gonna be so much more different than that of your peers. And the fact that, you know, yeah, I can't imagine I'm, you're going, I, I can't imagine coming out and that age particularly and seeing everyone going on. And that's an age where people won't stop to wanna really engage and understand where you're coming from. Cause life is twofold for them.

And, um, I just thought, geez, that, I mean, that's how I felt was not like an angel. But, um, hiding out in, once I got home, I didn't want to feel, I didn't, I felt really vulnerable. I didn't want to feel vulnerable, um, in front of people, which I've been through before, and it's so stupid. But yet anyway, so it just seemed quite bright out. It wasn't a nice day or anything. Um, but, uh, I, I just like that it's sort of, it, it felt like, kind of like, uh, what my experiences have sort of done to me. Not that I'm isolated. I have a lot of people in my life for sure, but that's that inner time when you don't feel people can relate to what you might have to say, or you don't wanna not burden them. But I don't know, I, I always want to be invisible when I'm really vulnerable. Um, and that's probably not a great trait.

So the first time I was, I was in, I was gone, you couldn't find me, I, uh, called up my dad and said, dad, I just can't, I thought I could do this, but I, uh, whatever.

Um, and to maybe have that inner world that we may have found at the ICU  I know for me, this is what actually brought me to get out of it in a, in a positive way, but I think it's introspection and to that we all come stronger with time.

So, um, and then having to rely on others to care for me, and not being able to do the simplest of tasks in my home. I couldn't, like I said, I had to have a family member that basically happy, had to work, he had to get back to work.

Um, also the ornaments talking about my life, like really, we put everything from our, the birth of my first baby to a mountain that we just visited. Like, it's just a story of our life. So I figured the tree was just representing my experience, uh, through, through the ICU. And then yesterday, um, it was a hectic day and I was just, uh, with my, my youngest daughter, she was napping in the car, and I was waiting for my eldest.

Um, so as I was driving, um, the sunset just, you know, appeared on this picture, but it's hard for you maybe to see, but it, it was actually, it's called a  crepuscular sunset. So where you see the sun, there's, it was actually a beam going all the way up to the sky. Um, it's, it was hard. It's hard to sound the picture, but it, it really happened. And I never seen that in my life.

I had my youngest baby that was just 13 months that I had to take care of. I had no energy. So there was still some obstacles in front of me, but there was that beam right there, and I was just keeping an eye on that, uh, mentally.

I can't do anything like being very vocal about my capacities, but at the same time, setting small steps every day, um, to walk further and, and faster and kind of like self-motivate. But through that process, I felt very alone, very, very alone. And you wanna show that you're strong and that you have it, everything, you know, all together. But in reality, I was far from it. And three months later, that's when my, you know, post, uh, ICU episode happened.

Um, and do the second, um, the second question. And I think what I'm gonna do is, um, we're actually doing pretty good on time, so we'll, we'll see how things go if I need you to wind it up. Why don't I do this? Okay. This is your 10 like wrap up in about 10 more seconds. There you go. How does that look? Okay. Yeah. And then I, like I said, if you have more to say, say, and we don't have time for it, please just chat, chat, chat, and type in the chat. Excellent. So we are back over to P3 and Facilitator FH is gonna bring up your image and what were challenges and facilitators to this transition. Oh, she's so sweet.\"}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '00:50:46)', 'speech': \" It's a he by the way.\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': \" Oh, it's a he.\"}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '00:50:49)', 'speech': \" Yeah, that is, uh, Abe, his actual name, his registered name was Honest Abe. But we just call him Abe or Abert, and you about facilitators. He was in my recovery and one of the first things I couldn't to get home too, I mean, I saw my husband in the hospital. I had my sister, my son was visiting, friends, came to visit. But this love of my life here, my poor baby. At one point we talked about them bringing him into the hospital, but he's, um, he is pretty stressed out when he rides in the car. He doesn't like riding the carrier. So I didn't wanna put him through that. But, um, so, and it was, um, interesting. I couldn't wait to see him as we walked through the doors. I came in through the garage cause I, I had to hold onto walls and things to get into the house.\"}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '00:51:41)', 'speech': \" He was having what he has like asthma and asthma attacks. So it wasn't quite the welcoming I was expecting. And then he ignored me for about 10 minutes and I was heartbroken, what do you mean? And then from there on in, he was my shadow and he still is. So, um, he played a big role and just like that was something normal. That was something important for me to get home to, um, that I couldn't have while I was in recovery while I was [inaudible] in the hospital. So he was one of my biggest facilitators. I guess the big thing missing is the other people in my life, but, um, printer's not working. And the biggest one, I mean, I have my husband here, but my sister will be huge role, but she in prints ever dial in to get the consent forms and everything's fine. Would've been just too much of a hassle. So, but so that's missing from this photo. But, um, yeah, he is, uh, pets give that unconditional love. And so for those times, feeling like nobody understood and nobody could, you know, not that I had that experience too much, but it was just there in my face constantly. So he's my love, one of them. Sorry Rob. My husband's on the couch, so I gotta make sure he hears that.\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': ' <laugh>.

So Yeah, you have to have, uh, you have to have the human around. Yeah. It's a lovely photo, um, of, of your, your facilitator, uh, to your, to, to your recovery. And, um, you know, totally relate to that. Uh, was I, how did it feel to be without in, I mean, in the hospital, like you had realized, yeah,\"}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '00:53:42)', 'speech': \" I worried about him, because he is mine. You know, like it cats little attached to, and, and, and there were days where my husband, once he got back to work, um, he'd be out of the house at five in the morning and then he worked, I was ended up transferring to, um, [hospital]. But, um, so my husband would be out of the house from five in the morning and after his day of work come to the hospital every day, he never missed a day to come see me, ever. Oh. Ever, ever. And so he would be getting home some nights at, I'd be kicking him out at 6 30, 7 at the hospital saying, you gotta go home. So that's cat spent hours and hours alone. So I worried about him. So yeah. So <laugh>, it was a good thing to get home to him knowing that he would have somebody around\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': ' You, have some comfort.'}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '00:54:34)', 'speech': \" Yeah, and my sister was here. She was back and forth and she'd come faithfully every day she'd get up. And for somebody that lives in small Prince  Rhode Island, having to drive from [city] to harassments every day was a nerve-wracking experience. But she did it. And, uh, so she was out of the house a lot, but she did her best to comfort him while I wasn't. Yeah.\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': ' Thanks Yeah. Thank you so much.'}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '00:55:03)', 'speech': \" Hospitals do allow pet visits now.

Um, but yeah, absolutely adorable. Um, I also wonder if it, it feels pretty, would it be nice to know that, you know, um, rather than relying on, um, saying like hospital staff and family for help, you know, it, it was also nice to know that, um, someone relied on you and, um, it could have been cat. Yeah, I think that'd be really nice. Um, but yeah, the way, the way you worded that was\"}, {'participant': 'P1', 'time': '00:56:22)', 'speech': ' Really uplifting <laugh>.

Um, and I, you know, as soon as you said that, of course, uh, it just resonated, uh, be, I mean, what would I have done if I didn't have my pets? And I always have had, I've been lucky enough that, um, I had a cat for 18 years and then I got another cat for 18 years. Wow. And yeah, so lucky. And there was, there were a dog or two in there, but at any rate, oh, if I didn't have some, we now have a young cat cuz all of our, our other ones have passed away in this past Covid time. Um, but she's just awesome. And like all the animals, like you get home and, uh, that's it. It's just, you know, love there. Nobody's questioning anything, just wanna be in your company. And so that's, uh, that's great. That really resonated with me. Thanks.\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': \" Thank you.

Oh. But it reminds us of like the simple things, right? That you're maybe more in tune after the ICU on the needs that you have and the simple need of having comfort and maybe even affection from your pets, and then maybe the people around you. I know for me, I was more open to touching, uh, people around me, uh, after I think it kind of cut a barrier that I maybe had before. Um, so very lucky that you have a little football. I wish I could have one. We have a parrot as you know. So Yeah, <laugh> another kind of cuteness <laugh>.\"}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '00:58:24)', 'speech': \" We'll have to put them together.

And this is your barriers and facilitators. Excellent.'}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '00:58:55)', 'speech': \" And again, like I said, I I kind of just meshed both the questions together, <laugh>, so mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, so I'll, I'll, I'll try. But, um, the title of this one is The Tracks of My Tears. And really it was inspired by the song by Smokey Robinson. And for those of you that aren't familiar, I won't, I won't sing it, but I'll just, uh, say a line, um, take a good look at my face. You'll see my smile looks out of place. And if you look closer, it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears. And I think one of the hardest things in coming home was I was feeling so vulnerable and just crushed and feeling my emotions were all over the place. But, you know, the second that I stepped out of the car to make my way into the house, I felt like I had to put a mask on.\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '00:59:41)', 'speech': \" Um, I had to put on my brave face, and I didn't feel that I was allowed to show, um, what I was really experiencing. Um, a lot of that was just my, my need to feel like I had to protect everybody around me. That I had to put their emotions and their feelings and their needs above mine, even though I was in such a low place. And, um, my parents were flying out from Nova Scotia on the day that I, you know, went into, uh, severe medical distress and ended up, you know, in the ICU. Um, but they had no idea because they were coming. I was supposed to have knee surgery three days later, so they were coming for my knee surgery. And they didn't know until they landed at the airport that everything had gone sideways. And that, um, you know, things had gotten really bad and my mom didn't cope very well.\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '01:00:35)', 'speech': \" Um, my sister had ended up in the ICU several years ago when she had my niece with sepsis, which I know many of you can, uh, relate to, and, you know, almost died. And my mom never really recovered from that. I think she had a lot of PTS D. So when she found out that, you know, what had happened to me, uh, she really wasn't co coping well. And so I was more worried about how everybody else was doing. Um, so, you know, my kids were really traumatized by the event. They were all, they were here when it happened. Uh, my husband and my oldest son had to do CPR on me at home. Um, so I mean, they, you know, my oldest son was having his own PTSD and traumatized. Um, when I came home, you know, I was experiencing huge anxiety.\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '01:01:23)', 'speech': \" I was having panic attacks, I was having heart palpitations. I couldn't sleep. But I, I just had to go through that on my own, you know, I couldn't say anything. And despite how much pain I was in or how low, you know, I was feeling, or how much I just wanted to sit and cry, I, I just had to slap the smile on my face and pretend like everything was fine. Um, I had to have a, one of the complications while I was in the ICU  is I had, I developed compartment syndrome in my left arm from a, a, a ruptured, uh, brachial artery from an art line. So I had to have an emergency fasciotomy. So my left arm was completely cut open, unusable. Um, I was in a lot of pain. My mom was really, really upset about my arm. And so I just had to say, you know, oh, it's fine.\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '01:02:10)', 'speech': \" Oh, look how good it is today. You know, like, look, I can, I can lift it <laugh>. Um, but, you know, I couldn't feed myself. I couldn't look after myself. I couldn't do anything. But again, I just felt that need to put on the mask of the person who was happy and unaffected and feeling great when the reality is that I was feeling the opposite. And I think the biggest challenge of transitioning to home really was, um, for me, like that mental health aspect. Um, you know, I was seeing orthopedic surgeons for my knee. I was seeing plastic surgery for my fasciotomy, and I needed more surgery for that. I was going, having to go to the hand clinic for hand rehab. I was seeing hematology for my anticoagulation in my genetic workup. I was seeing vascular surgery. I had post thrombo-, I have post thrombolytic syndrome.\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '01:02:58)', 'speech': \" I had to have more MRIs. I was seeing cardiology for echoes and monitoring of my pulmonary pressures. I was seeing wound care for looking after my open wound. I was having to have weekly visits with my family physician. I was seeing physiotherapy. Um, and I went very quickly from being a healthy person. I was incredibly active. I played tennis. I went hiking. I had a meaningful job. I looked after my family. I looked after my house. I did everything in the household to all of a sudden being able to do none of that, seeing all of those health professionals, I needed to have almost a a personal attendant to keep track of the appointments because it was just so overwhelming. But nobody ever once asked me, how are you doing? Like, nobody ever ever asked how I was feeling, or how I was doing, or how I was coping, or how I was managing. So on my own, I did seek out some mental health support and I ended up finding, um, a psychologist that I could go and see on my own. But that should have been part of everything. And that should have been from the get-go, um, when you're sent home from the hospital with all of this going on. Um, I think that that really needs to be addressed.\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': \" Thank you, P4. And just to let you know that we will be addressing mental health, um, in a later session, I think not next week, but the week after. So we'll be talking more extensively. Um, may I ask you a follow up? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> question. Um, I'm just wondering, so you talk about this mask that you had to put on and you had to be okay for your, you know, your immediate family and your, and sort of whole things together. Did you have moments where it was okay to, to just feel what you were feeling?\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '01:05:04)', 'speech': ' If I was by myself, not, not with anybody.'}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': ' And at this point, does your family even realize that, or is the, that mask still in place?'}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '01:05:18)', 'speech': \" Yeah, no. Like, I still can't, I, you know, I, my, my mom is having her own, you know, they, they were only here for a couple weeks and then they had to go back to Nova Scotia, and then, um, my niece came out from Calgary to look after me. Um, but I mean, no. I mean, I, I still have to, um, just pretend, you know, that my, my, um, recovery's going really, really well and that every, you know, like, I, I had an ultrasound last Friday and, um, you know, I still have lots of clot, you know, still in my legs. And now I have to go and have another, um, uh, VQ scan in my lungs again. And, um, I had an appointment with the hematologist today, but, you know, I won't, I won't tell my mom that or talk to my mom about that or anything. Cause it's just, I just have to say, oh, I'm doing great. Everything's fine. Doing great, doing my physio. It's great.\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': \" Thanks for sharing. I'm gonna turn it over to, P1, to start us off.\"}, {'participant': 'P1', 'time': '01:06:23)', 'speech': \" I have a lot of respect for everything you went through. That sounds like a treasured journey. And, um, I, I know if I were in your position, I don't, I don't think I would be able to, you know, still care for others and, um, you know, put on a constant facade of being all right. Um, so that is, you're definitely very strong for that. Um, and I, it must be extremely hard having, while you're going through your own struggles, your family is too, and though you are helping them, they're, they're never really getting back to you with yours. And it's, it's kind of unfair. I'm not sure how you cope with that, but, um, that is incredibly tough. And I, I hope you give yourself some kindness.\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '01:07:17)', 'speech': ' Thank you.'}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': \" Thanks P1. And we'll move on to P2.\"}, {'participant': 'P2', 'time': '01:07:23)', 'speech': \" Yeah, P4. That, that was, um, that was spot on as far as, I mean, I think I'm more selfish than I used to be. And I don't, I mean, the good selfish mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but it's like, that's, I've been a caregiver. That's what, that was my role in the family. That was my role. I remember I, um, anyway, um, not important. Um, but I mean, by family, I mean brothers and sisters and whatnot. And, uh, it just always has been. Those were the, the, um, that, that's, that's, that was a career I went into, and in all manner of different things, but always that, so to, I didn't consider it to be something that would, that I didn't have  you know, the ability to access. So when you say that, I hear it so profoundly, um, not just cuz it's me, but I just felt like what you said was, ugh. Mental hug. <laugh>. Thank you. <laugh>. Oh, teenagers though. Oh, anyways. Thank you. Thank you P4.\"}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '01:08:37)', 'speech': ' Thanks'}, {'participant': 'P5', 'time': '01:08:40)', 'speech': \" Thank you so much, P4, for sharing. You should be very, very proud of yourself for the degree of introspection that you have with how you've gone through the whole experience. What are your challenges? Most people are not even there. They're, they're maybe losing themselves, especially with all the appointments. And, and so at the same time that facade is there, you're still living and being aligned with how you feel now. There's a lot of energy that you're actually putting into that mask. And maybe with time to shift it to go more into this self care and, and opening up, uh, we'll get you to heal even more. Thank you for sharing.\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': ' Thank you. And over to P3.'}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '01:09:27)', 'speech': ' I hope I can talk without crying. <laugh>'}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '01:09:32)', 'speech': ''}, {'participant': 'P4,', 'time': '', 'speech': ''}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '01:10:36)', 'speech': \" But like P5, I hope at some point in time that you'll feel maybe some vulnerability to share with your family, some of what you've been feeling as they progress. I don't know how long ago you were sick and where everybody is, if it's still too soon. But I think that that's an important thing for you to be able to move forward and to, um, be okay with not being okay because, um, yeah. And that's for Smokey. Yeah, actually, that song hits lots for me. I spent my entire life dealing with obesity and tracks of my tears are a song that speaks a lot to living life and putting on faces that you're okay and you're fine. So, um, but it's like P5 says, hopefully you can let that mass go sometimes and feel safe or find a group or people that you can, and hopefully we're one of them right now, but others in your real life and reach out to somebody. Do you have a siblings that you could, like you talked about a sister that has had a shared experience.\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '01:11:54)', 'speech': \" Yeah, my sister's in Calgary. Um,\"}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '01:11:58)', 'speech': \" Yeah.

Yep.\"}, {'participant': 'P4', 'time': '01:12:15)', 'speech': ' Oh, thank you.'}, {'participant': 'P3', 'time': '01:12:15)', 'speech': ' Thank you for sharing. That picture was beautiful. Yeah, it, it really speaks to so much.'}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': \" Thank you. Okay, so now we're gonna move on to P1's photo. So challenges and facilitators.\"}, {'participant': 'P1', 'time': '01:12:36)', 'speech': \" Yeah, this is kind of an abstract photo. It's a little confusing, but, um, uh, the focus is on the pedestrian light. Um, it's kind of falling out its socket, um, uh, not socket, but it's, um, place <laugh>. Um, and I took this photo the other night, um, and I, and especially with like the rainy atmosphere, um, this was at like 12:00 AM I'm coming back from school. Um, it, it, it felt, it really evoked a lot of emotion in me. Um, and I think it represented a challenge of going back home, which was, um, just, just realizing how weak I was, especially surrounded by people who were so capable. Um, and, and like the sign I felt as if I was extremely, deeply damaged. Um, and, and so my voice was no longer as strong and that no one would take me seriously. And like, since the sign is kind of falling out, um, it's, it's signal to stop walking and it's not gonna be perceived as strong or that's how I interpreted it.\"}, {'participant': 'P1', 'time': '01:13:34)', 'speech': \" Um, so I didn't feel as I would be listened too seriously and, um, rather I felt powerless and weak. Um, but, you know, like how it's, like how the pedestrian sign is still glowing. Um, it was, it, it was trying really hard to show that it was functional and still working. And, um, that's how I felt as well to there, there was like a strong inherent need to always prove myself to everyone, that I wasn't totally broken and I, I still had some worth. Um, and it, it was, it was a difficult transition cause you know, going home, it, it was really crazy. My family was really disappointed in me now that I was kind of like a damaged good and I wasn't of high value. And I think that was really hard because I, I, I wasn't like, you know, the kid that they wanted me to be.\"}, {'participant': 'P1', 'time': '01:14:30)', 'speech': \" Um, and I think that was really a struggle. So I, I really wanted to prove myself that prove to myself and to them that I was still of some value. Um, but, you know, like having physical weaknesses, you know, like being in for a [inaudible] or having, like, losing so much hair or my teeth, it was, it was a clear sign that, you know, I couldn't cover up that, that I had failed in some ways, even though I didn't like, um, do anything to fail. And it was, it was really hard getting out of this mindset cause it's so incredibly negative. And that was definitely, um, a challenge. Um, but yeah, and a bit different. But, uh, the light also reminded me of, and especially with like, you know, the walk light, how it makes a noise. Um, it reminded me of like the noises, like the beeps and the, the lights that you would see in the hospital.\"}, {'participant': 'P1', 'time': '01:15:24)', 'speech': \" And that, and that's like always a trigger for me. Hearing the repetitive beeping or the flashing lights. Like I, there was never pure darkness and, um, it always invokes the same feeling of helplessness that I felt in the hospital. Um, so that was also a challenge. But one facilitator that, uh, this reminded me of is actually the light. Uh, and being outside, being outside was such a huge benefit to my mental health, I think because just standing in direct sunlight, uh, really helped me feel, um, myself again and made me feel alive. Um, and it was just incredible feeling sun against my skin again. Uh, yeah.\"}, {'participant': 'Facilitator', 'time': '', 'speech': \" Thank you P1. It sounds like, um, yeah, taking things for granted like sunlight and then you sort of rediscovering that for your, for yourself. I just wanted to dial back a little bit. Um, so you talked a a lot about like, expectations of your family and the people around you and feeling like a failure. Can I, can I ask, like, do you still feel that same way today? Has that shifted a lot for you? Or is this something you're working on?\"}]\n"
